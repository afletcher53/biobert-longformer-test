Some weights of BertForMaskedLM were not initialized from the model checkpoint at dmis-lab/biobert-v1.1 and are newly initialized: ['cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
