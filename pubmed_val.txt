In dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg. kg -1 i.v.), clonidine (0,01 mg.kg-1 i.v.) reduced the tachycardia induced at low frequencies by stimulation of the cardiac nerve. The effects of some alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents on this effect have been studied. Small doses of yohimbine (0.3 mg. kg-1 i.v.) or piperoxan (0.3 mg. kg-1 i.v.) increased the effects of the stimulation and in addition antagonized the inhibitory effects of clonidine and reversed the pressor response to adrenaline. Thymoxamine (1 mg.kg-1 i.v.) and prazosin (1 mg.kg-1 i.v.) did not increase the effect of the stimulation of the cardiac nerve, but reduced the effect of clonidine. ARC239 (0.05 mg.kg-1) reversed the pressor response to adrenaline but even at high doses did not increase the effects of the stimulation of the cardiac nerve or the effects of clonidine. These observations afford further evidence for a dissimilarity between pre and post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors.

In the Mouse, gamma-glutamyl transferase distribution changes with development in the kidney and the liver; on the contrary, its activity remains almost equal and low in other organs. In the liver, a low activity is observed in the fetus and the new-born up to the 3rd day of life; then it is no more measurable. In the kidney, the low enzyme activity of the fetus is multiplied by 10 in the 10 first days of life and by 50 in the 6 first weeks.

We have shown that, if Scorpion venom is acting a skeletal muscle indirectly by releasing Acetycholine and directly by inducing an increase in intracellular free calcium, the main action of toxin II isolated from Anemonia Sulcata tentacles is presynaptic.

In our experimental conditions, toxin II from Anemonia sulcata restored Frog neuromuscular transmission blocked by botulinum toxin, type A.

In an investigation into the disturbances of body function associated with burn injury we have measured the activity of alkaline ribonuclease (EC 3.1.4.22) and the level of urate in the serum and urine of patients sustaining burn injury. Ribonuclease activity was elevated in all patients. The degree of elevation can be related to the percentage of the body surface area burned and to a predictive index of burn mortality. Increased serum ribonuclease activity was accompanied by increased urine ribonuclease output. The relationship between serum urea and ribonuclease activity has been investigated. A significant correlation between these two parameters was observed during the first week post burn. We suggest that this correlation shows as a result of increased protein catabolism and renal dysfunction. After the first week a significant correlation between serum urea and ribonuclease activity was not observed. It is possible that, at this stage, increased ribonuclease activity is perhaps a result of tissue repair. Serum urate was found to be decreased in all patients after burn injury. Serum urate decrease expressed as a percentage of initial value, correlated very strongly with the predictive index of burn mortality. In severely burned patients the decrease in serum urate was accompanied by increased urine urate output and may indicate a change in renal handling of urate after burn injury.

A study of the pH optimum of alkaline phosphatase activity in calibration and control serum preparations reveals a wide variation in pH optima. It is shown that as small an error of +/- 0.05 pH units in preparation of the buffered substrate results in an error in the order of +/- 5% in the response between the calibrating serum and patient specimens. It is recommended that a calibration serum should closely parallel the pH optimum of alkaline phosphatase in human sera and that a quality control serum containing alkaline phosphatase of alternative source to that present in the calibration serum be included with patient samples as a sensitive means of monitoring pH changes in the buffered substrate.

1. A human cancer cell line (COLO 16) derived originally from an epidermal squamous cell carcinoma was found to possess adenylate cyclase responsiveness to beta-adrenergic agonists. 2. The adenylate cyclase response was characterized with respect to activation constants (KA) for various beta-adrenergic agonists and inhibition constants (Ki) for antagonists. 3. Intact cells responded with dose-dependent increases in production of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. 4. Properties of the beta-adrenergic receptor were evaluated by using the specific binding of [3H]propranolol to cell membranes. Specific binding was saturable, with KD 5.79 nmol/l and binding sites 0.68 pmol/mg of protein. 5. Competition for binding to cell membranes was shown by beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists and was stereospecific. There was close agreement between the affinity of these various agents on adenylate cyclase and receptor binding. 6. It is likely that the beta-adrenergic receptor-linked adenylate cyclase in COLO 16 cells represents persistence in a cancer cell line of a receptor present normally in epidermal cells.

1. The properties of inactive and active renin in human plasma and amniotic fluid were studied chromatographically. Activation was achieved at pH 3.3 with and without added pepsin. 2. Acid activation of renin was time- and temperature-dependent but was inhibited by dilution of the sample. The dilution effect was corrected by adding pepsin. Such characteristics indicate that activation at low pH is catalysed by intrinsic enzymes. 3. Separation and/or dilution of the activating enzyme during ion-exchange chromatography concealed the eluted position of inactive renin and reduced the amount recovered. Only after full activation of the eluted renin was achieved with added pepsin was a distinct peak of inactive renin exposed. 4. At pH 7.5 inactive renin carried a lower negative charge than the active enzyme. This charge difference was lost after activation. 5. No molecular-weight differences between active, inactive renin or the International Renin Standard were detected by gel filtration. No renin of larger molecular weight was present. 6. These findings will be helpful in purification studies of human inactive renin.

(1) AIN is the most frequent pattern of drug-induced immunologically mediated renal injury. A number of drugs may be responsible for AIN, namely methicillin and other penicillin derivatives, rifampicin, phenindione and sulfonamides. Particular clinical and pathological features often suggest an immune pathogenetic mechanism. IgG anti-TBM and IgE antibodies have been found in only a few cases and it is likely that antibody-mediated and cell-mediated injury may operate in the same patient. (2) Only few examples of drug-induced vasculitis and glomerulonephritis are known, and the pathophysiology of this kind of renal damage is poorly understood.

This study examines the possibility that changes of cerebral extracellular pH (PH e) or adenosine concentration may provide coupling mechanisms of a general nautre, adjusting cerebral blood flow (CBF) to metabolic demands. Although there is considerable indirect evidence that CBF varies inversely with pHe, results obtained during the last few years indicate that large increases in flow may occur in the absence of a fall in pHe. Thus, induction of hypoxia or epileptic seizures leads to maximal increase in CBF before pHe falls or even when there is initial alkalosis due to concomitant hypocapnia. Furthermore, CBF increases in hypoglycaemia and after administration of amphetamine, two conditions unassociated with tissue acidosis. The possibility that adenosine may be a coupling factor was examined in hypoxia and during epileptic seizures in rats. In both conditions a four- to fivefold increase in CBF occurs in spite of the fact that tissue adenosine concentrations remain at or below 1 mumolkg-u. It is concluded that adenosine accumulates first when there is a perturbation of cerebral energy state with a rise in AMP concentration. It seems unlikely that adenosine, formed by breakdown of AMP, acts as a general coupling factor.

The effects of some general anaesthetics, for example thiopentone, Althesin (alphaxalone + alphadolone) and ketamine, on cerebral vascular smooth muscle are those which would be expected from their metabolic actions. With other anaesthetics, mainly those administered by inhalation, and especially the volatile agents, cerebral blood flow increases in excess of the metabolic activity, which is usually depressed to varying degrees. During general anaesthesia with any of these agents, responses to changes in arterial Pco2 or blood pressure are maintained. Furthermore, when seizure activity occurs during enflurane administration, there is a flow response to the associated metabolic stimulation. The time course of the flow response to the metabolically depressant drug Althesin has been measured in baboons and shown to be very rapid. Wtih this drug cerebrovascular resistance begins to increase within 2 s of its arrival in the brain. This rapid flow change occurs also after sympathetic denervation. Extracellular fluid pH of the cortex does not alter until after the initiation of the vascular smooth muscle response.

Adenosine and H+ may act synergistically to regulate cerebral blood flow because adenosine production is enhanced under various experimental conditions associated with an imbalance between oxygen supply and oxygen need. Direct application of adenosine dilates the pial vessels, but changes in cerebral vascular resistance are not observed when adenosine is infused intraarterially. This is because adenosine does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. The studies reported here show that in dogs the adenosine released into the interstitium is partly reincorporated into adenine nucleotides via an adenosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.20) reaction (salvage pathway) and partly degraded to inosine and hypoxanthine. However, in contrast to other tissues, the accumulation of iosine and hypoxanthine in brain tissue proceeds at a rate slower than that of adenosine because one of the degradative enzymes, namely purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1) is located only in the vessel wall, which is not readily permeable to adenosine. Thus, the slow access of adenosine to its degradative enzymes delays the appearance of its products, inosine and hypoxanthine.

The investigation was designed to identify microenvironmental factors that might be important in the regulation of local blood flow. Cellular microenvironment in terms of Po2, pH, [K+], [Cl-], [Ca2+] and lactate was measured in rat brain by means of specific microelectrodes. Vascular endothelium was stained in vivo with Thioflavine S. Local blood flow was measured with micro hydrogen electrodes. Some intracellular measurements of pH were made in conjunction with extracellular measurements. The main findings were that local autoregulation responses and blood flow changes in response to imposed hypoxic changes were very rapid (1-1.5 s). Microflow responses to changes in local cell activity were limited to a region not more than 250 micron in diameter. Increased blood flow in acute hypoxia occurred within 1-2 s of the fall in tissue Po2 and was much more rapid than changes in either pH or potassium. Intracellular pH changed within 10 s of the onset of severe hypoxia but in all cases the blood flow followed the Po2 much more closely than any other parameter. It is suggested that changes in capillary endothelium and local membrane transmission may play a part in autoregulatory mechanisms.

Bromcarbamide-containing sleeping pills are frequently used in suicide attempts and cause severe, often fatal, intoxication. Since 1975, the chemically related drug diethylpentenamide had been available (in the German Federal Republic) without prescription. The authors report four cases of attempted suicide with the drug. The signs were similar to those after carbromal intoxication. There was severe respiratory depression, successfully treated by extracorporeal detoxication with combined haemoperfusion and haemodialysis. One patient developed acute pancreatitis as a complication.

In a 25-year old woman with ulcerative colitis a lupus erythematosus syndrome occurred during treatment with salazosulfapyridine. The connection with medication was ascertained by reexposition. Some of the systemic complications of ulcerative colitis may possibly be due to the salazosulfapyridine medication.

Treatment of hemicastrated adult female rats with nicotine increased the compensatory ovarian hypertrophy (COH) while central n-cholinolytic IEM-506 decreased COH and prevented the estrogen-induced suppression of COH. Administration of L-DOPA abolished the effect of IEM-506, and disulfiram blocked gonadotropic action of nicotine. Elevation of the dose of arecoline decreased COH and the sensitivity of hypothalamo-gonadotropic complex to estrogen suppression. Treatment of rats with L-DOPA and disulfiram abolished the late effect of arecoline. Central m-cholinolytic metamizyl decreased COH, potentiated the effect of estrogen and prevented the gonadotropic effect of L-DOPA. The regulatory role of m-cholinergic systems in noradrenaline mediation of gonadotropic function and n-cholinergic system in dopamine ones are suggested.

Pancreatic islets contain an enzyme system which catalyzes the donation of hydrogen from NAD(P)H to menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone). In high concentrations (20 to 50 micrometer), menadione, in addition to lowering the concentration of reduced pyridine nucleotides in the islets, also impairs glycolysis and glucose oxidation, decreases ATP concentration, and inhibits proinsulin biosynthesis. However, at a 10 micrometer concentration, menadione fails to affect the concentration of adenine nucleotides, the utilization of glucose, the production of lactate and pyruvate, the oxidation of [6-14C]glucose and the synthesis of proinsulin; whereas the metabolism of glucose through the pentose shunt is markedly increased. The sole inhibitory effect of menadione 10 micrometer upon metabolic parameters is to reduce the concentration of both NADH and NADPH, such an effect being noticed in islets exposed to glucose 11.1 mM but not in those incubated at a higher glucose level (27.8 mM). Since, in the presence of glucose 11.1 mM, menadione 10 micrometer also severely decreases glucose-stimulated45 calcium net uptake and subsequent insulin release, it is concluded that the availability of reduced pyridine nucleotides may play an essential role in the secretory sequence by coupling metabolic to cationic events. Thus, when insulinotropic nutrients are oxidized in the B-cell, the increased availability of reduced pyridine nucleotides could modify the affinity for cations of native ionophoretic systems, eventually leading to the accumulation of calcium up to a level sufficient to trigger insulin release.

Three methods, chromatographic, spectrophotometric and tritium-release assay, were used and compared for the assay of deoxycytidylate methyltransferase. All three methods can be used for assay of this enzyme but the tritium-release assay appears to be the most simple and convenient. With the help of this assay the deoxycytidylate methyltransferase has been isolated and purified from sonically disrupted cells of Xp12-infected Xanthomonas oryzae. Using a procedure that involves fractionation with streptomycin sulfate and ammonium sulfate, filtration through Sephadex G-100 and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, a 214-fold increase in specific activity was obtained. The enzyme displays a narrow pH optimum at 6.0 Among the buffers tested, 6-morpholinoethane sulfonate with the addition of Mg2 is the best. The enzyme can utilize dCMP as a substrate. The enzyme can also convert tetrahydrofolic acid into dihydrofolic acid. The Km value for dCMP is 31.3 micrometer and the Km value for tetrahydrofolic acid is 71.4 micrometer. There is no absolute requirement of ions for the activity of the enzyme; however, the presence of ions causes stimulating or inhibiting effects on enzyme activity that are dependent on the variety and concentration of ions used.

The effect of pH upon the beta-galactosidase-catalyzed hydrolyses of aryl galactosides is essentially similar for each of the three steps of their hydrolysis. It differs markedly from that on the hydrolysis of galactosyl pyridinium salts; these proceed through a 'non-bottleneck' pathway. While pH increase abolishes the rate of every step of the reaction for aryl galactosides, it favors the first step of hydrolysis of the galactosyl pyridinium salts, which supports the hypothesis that catalysis of these compounds originates largely in non-covalent interactions.

1. Kinetic relationships referring to multiple-turnover conditions have been derived for the slowest exponential transient appearing in two-substrate enzyme reactions proceeding by an ordered ternary-complex mechanism. The validity of these and previously derived theoretical relationships for this mechanism has been tested by application to the liver alcohol dehydrogenase reaction. 2. All essential features of the transient-state kinetics of alcohol oxidation by NAD+ in the liver alcohol dehydrogenase system can be qualitatively and quantitatively explained in view of the compulsory-order mechanism in the proposed scheme. There is no kinetic evidence for any half-of-the-sites reactivity of the enzyme. A consistent set of rate constants is reported for the enzymic oxidation of benzyl alcohol at pH 8.75. 3. Transient-state rate parameters for benzyl alcohol/benzaldehyde catalysis by liver alcohol dehydrogenase have been determined at different pH. The interpretation of such rate parameters is critically discussed with reference to their informative value for the purpose of determination of rate constants (k and k') for the process of ternary-complex interconversion in the proposed scheme. It is concluded that the apparent rate constant (k') for hydride transfer from benzyl alcohol to NAD+ is dependent on a proton dissociation step with a pKa of 6.4, whereas the rate constant (k) for hydride transfer from NADH to benzaldehyde exhibits no corresponding dependence on proton association. 4. The asymmetric pH dependence of the forward and reverse rate of ternary-complex interconversion during liver alcohol dehydrogenase catalysis appears to reflect an obligatory step of alcohol/alcoholate ion equilibration occurring at the ternary-complex level. It is suggested that the observed pKa 6.4 dependence of the transient rate of alcohol oxidation can be attributed to a coupled acid-base system involving minimally the enzyme-bound alcohol and the protein residues Ser-48 and His-51.

A multiprotein complex which contains in equimolar amounts two cytochromes b (Mr each about 27,000), one cytochrome c1 (Mr 31,000) and six subunits without known prosthetic groups (Mr 8000, 12,000, 14,000, 45,000, 45,000, and 50,000) has been isolated from the mitochondrial membranes of Neurospora crassa by affinity chromatography on immobilized cytochrome c. The chromatographic separation was based upon the specific binding of the complex to ferricytochrome c coupled to Sepharose and its specific release upon conversion of the coupled ferricytochrome c into ferrocytochrome c using ascorbate as a reductant. The chromatography was performed in the presence of the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 at low ionic strengths. A monodisperse preparation of the multiprotein complex was obtained which was used for binding studies with cytochrome c from Neurospora crassa, horse heart and Saccaromyces cerevisiae. At low ionic strength (20 mM Trisacetate) and slightly alkaline pH (pH 7 to 8), more than one molecule of ferricytochrome c were bound to the isolated multiprotein complex with dissociation constants below 1 x 10(-7) M. One of these bindings appeared different from the others, since its high affinity was preserved at an ionic strength at which the affinities of the other bindings decreased. Furthermore, the affinity of only this binding decreased upon reduction of cytochrome c. It is suggested that this binding is at or near the functionally active site(s) of the mulipprotein complex.

The reduction of methemoglobin by cobaltocytochrome c (Cocyt c) has been measured using nine mediators of different half-reduction potentials, Em, 7. The rate increases with the increase of Em, 7 for the mediator but dropped precipitously when it becomes more positive than the Em, 7 for the methemoglobin/hemoglobin couple. The reaction is most efficient with phenzaine methosulfate, therefore it was studied in detail. The reaction is first order in the concentrations of Cocyt c and phenazine methosulfate. The average second-order rate constant for Cocyt c + phenazine methosulfate (M) k1 leads to Cocyt c+ M-. is 2.9 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 at 25 degrees C, 0.1 M phosphate pH 7.0. There is a slight negative temperature dependence of k1 at low temperature; at higher temperatures the process has deltaH not equal to approximately 27 kJ mol-1 and deltaS not equal to approxmately - 75 J mol-1 K-1. The effect of anions reflects the dependence of Em, 7 for the methemoglobin/hemoglobin couple with various anions. There is no significant effect on k1 by the addition of inositol hexakisphosphate. The variation of k1 with pH is complicated. The experimental rate constants are compared with values calculated with the theory of nonadiabatic multiphonon process of electron tunneling.

The conformations of the metal-bound 5'-ribonucleotides and 5'-deoxyribonucleotides in aqueous solution at different pH values have been studied using the lanthanide probe method. The conformational analysis, based on mixing different conformations in fast exchange within the nuclear magnetic resonance time scale, agrees well with the results from coupling constants, nuclear Over-hauser effects and spin-lattice relaxation times, obtained for the metal-fixed systems. The equilibrium between the two basic conformational combinations for the 5'-nucleotides, anti-(N in equalibrium S)-gg-g'g' and syn-(N in equalibrium S)-gt-g'g' depends on the nature of the furanose ring, the base and also on the state of base protonation and phosphate ionization. The effect of base protonation is particularly strong for the guanine nucleotides.

Ecdysone 20-monooxygenase, an enzyme which converts ecdysone to ecdysterone (the major moulting hormone of insects) has been characterized in cell-free preparations of tissues from African migratory locust. The product of the reaction has been identified as ecdysterone on the basis of several microchemical derivatization and chromatographic methods. Ecdysone 20-monooxygenase activity is located primarily in the microsomal fraction which also carries NADPH cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome P-450, as shown by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Optimal conditions for the ecdysone 20-monooxygenase assay have been determined. The enzyme has a Km for ecdysone of 2.7 x 10(-7) M and is competitvely inhibited by ecdysterone (Ki = 7.5 x 10(-7) M). Ecdysone 20-monooxygenase is a typical cytochrome P-450 linked monooxygenase: the reaction requires O2 and is inhibited by CO, an effect partially reversed by white light. The enzyme is effectively inhibited by several specific monooxygenase inhibitors and by sulfhydryl reagents, but not by cyanide ions. Ecdysone elicits a type I difference spectrum when added to oxidized microsomes. NADPH acts as preferential electron donor. The transfer of reducing equivalents proceeds through NADPH cytochrome c (P-450) reductase: ecdysone 20-monooxygenase is inhibited by cytochrome c. Both NADPH cytochrome c reductase and ecdysone 20-monooxygenase are inhibited by NADP+ and show a similar Km for NADPH. The Malpighian tubules have the highest specific activity of ecdysone 20-monooxygenase, while fat body contain most of the cytochrome P-450 and NADPH cytochrome c reductase.

46 sweat-samples from 32 children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (C.F.) and 35 samples from 23 control-children were collected with glass micro-capillaries. Protein was determined by ultramicro-electrophoresis.

Erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG ) and adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) levels were determined in 43 children with chronic renal failure on conservative treatment (CT), and 12 children on regular hemodialysis (HD) immediately before and after a HD session. The results were compared to non-anemic and anemic controls. In spite of anemia, erythrocyte 2,3-DPG in renal failure was similar to non-anemic controls at normal blood pH, but rose during dialysis as a result of alkalosis. In contrast, ATP levels were high already at a normal blood pH. 2,3-DPG correlated with packed cell volume (PCV) in children with renal failure but at lower concentrations compared to controls. Both organic phosphates in the erythrocytes showed a significant correlation with blood pH. The poor increase of 2,3-DPG, in combination with elevated ATP levels, suggests uremia-induced inhibition of 2,3-DPG synthesis.

A patient presenting with severe metabolic acidosis accompanied by hyperglycinemia, hyperuricemia, hypoglycemia and hypertammonemia is described. Metabolic acidosis was found to be due to accumulated methylmalonic acid and did not respond to vitamin B12 administration. The patient showed favorable growth and development when kept on a low isoleucine, methionine, threonine and valine diet. In vitro studies using a lymphoid cell line derived from the patient showed a deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA carbonyl-mutase.

31 in-patients with anxiety entered at random in a double-blind clinical trial of chlordiazepoxide and camazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative. They were assessed by three different rating scales. Statistical evaluation of the results showed similar psychopharmacological activity of both drugs. It is concluded that camazepam is suitable for treatment of mild and severe anxiety states.

The antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs has been documented in a number of papers [10--13] and over the last 10 yr beta-receptor blockade has become a more and more frequent primary therapy for hypertension. During this time, a number of different beta-blockers with various degrees of selectivity, potency and intrinsic sympathomimetic effect have come into use. There have also been attempts to reduce the number of daily doses in beta-adrenoceptor blocking therapy while maintaining the antihypertensive effect [5]. Pindolol (Viskén) is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic effect and is characterized by high potency and long duration.

A possible interaction between the tetracyclic antidepressant mianserin and a coumarin derivative has been investigated. Sixty-three subjects, 61 of whom required anticoagulant therapy for a variety of medical conditions, were treated for 5 consecutive weeks with phenprocoumon, in a dose adjusted to reduce the prothrombin time to 15%-25%. After an initial control period of one week, subjects were randomly treated under double-blind conditions with mianserin 3 X 10 mg daily or 3 X 20 mg daily, or with a matching placebo. The dose of mianserin was gradually increased to reach the maximum by the 6th day. Three subjects dropped out and 60 completed the trial. The dose of phenprocoumon and the prothrombin, bleeding, and coagulation times were not significantly affected by administration of mianserin. It can be concluded that there is no clinically important interaction between phenprocoumon and doses of mianserin effective in depression. Sedation was more frequent in patients taking mianserin than in those given placebo.

The effects of hypercapnia on plasma renin concentration and blood pressure were studied in anaesthetized dogs, untreated and after pretreatment with guanethidine, propranolol or prazosin. An increase in plasma renin concentration which accompanied hypercapnia in untreated dogs was completely suppressed by pretreatment with guanethidine or propranolol. Prazosin significantly reduced but did not abolish renin release during hypercapnia. The pressor response normally occurring during hypercapnia was abolished by propranolol and reversed by guanethidine and prazosin.

The effect of gamma-rays on iron-free conalbumin was studied by isoelectric focusing technique. The results obtained can be interpreted on the basis of radiation-induced conformational changes of the macromolecules through a cleavage of disulphide bridges. Treatments with reagents acting on disulphide bridges lead to isoelectric focusing patterns that confirm this hypothesis.

Hemic hypoxia was produced in 7,30-day and 3--5-month old (adult) rats through introduction of sodium nitrite (100 mg/kg) with subsequent determination of the nicotinamide co-enzymes content in the myocardium. The effect of combined and separate application of the cardiac glycoside isolanide and beta-adrenoblocking agent trasicor under hypoxia at early stages of post-natal ontogenesis is shown.

The concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and zinc were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. The concentrations of all three cations were found to be strongly correlated with one another and with acidity (pH). Analysis of the relative concentrations in prostatic fluid, split ejaculates, and whole seminal plasma confirmed an almost exclusively prostatic origin of these cations. Semen quality, as judged by motility, vitality, concentration, and morphology of spermatozoa, was inversely related to cation concentrations. Therefore, we recommend adoption of the measurement of seminal divalent cations as part of the routine andrologic examination.

Twenty-five boys between 1 and 10 years of age with unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism were treated with 200 microgram of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pernasally six times daily until descensus was completed, or for 10 weeks at most. Complete descent of the tests occurred in 16 patients, usually after 2 to 5 weeks of treatment. No adverse side effects have been observed. Radioimmunologic measurements of serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and prolactin, carried out before treatment, at the end of treatment, and 6 months after treatment, showed a transitory increase of the LH responsiveness to GnRH in only four of the patients and in the group as a whole a slight but significant decrease of FSH responsiveness. There were no signs of precocious puberty. GnRH antibodies were not found.

Pernasal therapy of cryptorchidism with D-Leu6-des-Gly10-gonadotropin-releasing hormone ethylamide (D-Leu6-des-Gly10-GnRH-EA), a potent, long-acting GnRH analog, was attempted. Eleven prepubertal cryptorchid boys received between 25 microgram once daily and 25 to 50 microgram twice daily for 5 to 12 weeks. Complete testicular descent was achieved in 4 of the 11 boys. GnRH tests (1.5 microgram/kg intravenously), conducted in six boys before treatment, after 4 weeks of treatment, and in 2 boys 3 months after treatment, did not reveal changes in gonadotropin secretion indicative of precocious puberty or of decreased hypophyseal sensitivity to GnRH. Antibodies to the GnRH analog or to GnRH could not be detected.

A cytochemical study on the localization of the enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase was carried out in human ampullary glands. Although the former two enzymes showed a marked reactivity, alkaline phosphatase was absent from epithelial cells. On the basis of these results it is concluded that, as in the human seminal vesicle, in the ampullary gland fructose is probably secreted via the oxidative mechanism proposed by Hers (Le Metabolisme du Fructose. Bruxelles, Arscia, 1957).

Bone marrow cells recovered from bone nodules induced in mice by intramuscular transplantation of human FL cells were compared with the host femoral bone marrow. The precursors and mature forms of all types of blood cells were found in the induced bone marrow. The concentration of lymphocytes was significantly higher, and that of erythropoietic cells significantly lower in the induced bone marrow as compared with heterotopic femoral bone marrow.

The topical application of a 0.1% dimetindene maleate gel on the forearms of 11 subjects reduces the areas of both erythema and wheal produced by the intradermal injection of 0.025 mg of histamine hydrochloride to a statistically greater degree than 1% d-chlorpheniramine maleate cream (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.0005, respectively). The quantitative method employed in this study has proved to be an excellent means for the evaluation of the antihistaminic activity of topical preparations.

Different types of experimental hyperlactatemia and hyperpyruvicemia with or without lowering of blood pH were induced in anesthetized dogs. The initially studied experimental model was the hyperlactatemia and hyperpyruvicemia with lowering of blood pH induced by the intraduodenal administration of high doses of phenformin. Intravenous perfusion of sodium dichloroacetate (150 mg/kg infused during 20 minutes), which acts on the enzymatic complex of pyruvate dehydrogenase, reduced the hyperiactatemia and hyperpyruvicemia with or without acidosis provoked by phenformin injected intraduodenally (30 mg/kg), by intense muscular work, by hypoxia or by continous perfusion or adrenaline. Exogenous or endogenous insulin combined with sodium dichloracetate reduced the hyperlactatemia and hyperpyruvicemia as well as the changes in blood pH provoked by phenformin, more strongly than did sodium dichloroacetate alone. These findings have been confirmed in the conscious dog.

The effect of treatment with 0.04% (w/v) trypsin (EC 3.4.4.4) for 3 h on the electrophoretic mobility (EPM) of polyoma-virus malignantly transformed BHK21 cells (Py6) and their normal counterparts has been investigated. These particular conditions were chosen because an earlier study had shown that such treatment released material from the Py6 cells which was not obtained from the BHK21 cells. The negative EPM of the Py6 cells at pH 7.5 was greatly increased by this treatment; whereas the EPM of the BHK21 cells remained unchanged. Active enzyme was required to produce the change. No evidence was obtained for cytolysis, cytotoxicity or uptake of the enzyme by the treated Py6 cells. Measurement of the EPM of the Py6 cells at different pH levels before and after trypsin treatment suggested that the enzyme was removing cationic groupings from the cell surface.

In an attempt to elucidate the etiology of acute gastric bleeding and/or erosion and chronic peptic ulcer, a measurement of gastric juice and mucosal pepsin was carried out in surgically-treated patients. Patients with massive gastric mucosal bleeding in the fundic gland area showed high levels of fundic mucosal pepsin without acid-pepsin appearance in the gastric contents. In these patients, a significantly high value of the peptic activity ratio of gastric mucosa to gastric juice (MJPR, 36.4 +/- 6.7) was observed. It can be suggested that transient blockage of pepsin output from peptic cells with occur in the course of the acute mucosal bleeding, while acid-peptic digestion could be carried out within the fundic gland mucosa. On the other hand, a close correlation between relatively high acid-and-pepsin concentration of the gastric contents and a low level of MJPR (5.6 +/- 1.2) was observed in patients with chronic gastric ulcer. Patients who had a gastric ulcer within the pyloric gland mucosa had a highest acid-peptic activity among three groups with ulcers in fundic gland area, border zone and pyloric gland area. There is a rule that acid-peptic activity becomes low when the site of gastric ulcer moves from pylorus to fundus. A marked increase in acid-and-pepsin secretion into the gastric cavity was observed in patients suffering from chronic duodenal ulcer showing the lowest level of MJPR (3.40 +/- 0.50).

The mechanism for concentrating function of gallbladder was studied in vitro, turning and attention to changes in the gallbladder bile composition, especially a marked increase of Na+ and a marked decrease of Cl- in the concentrating process of hepatic bile to gallbladder one. The following results were obtained by the present investigations: 1) bile acids present in bile regulate the rate of Na+ and Cl- transport: 2) the epithelial membrane of the gallbladder can be regarded as being a simple semi-permeable membrane.

We examined 66 patients with pain of possible esophageal origin for sensitivity to intraesophageal infusions of coffee, orange juice, spicy tomato drink, or HCl of varying concentrations as an addendum to their acid infusion (Bernstein) tests. Compared to Berstein-negative subjects, acid-sensitive patients were sensitive to infusion of coffee (P less than 0.01), orange juice (P less than 0.001), and tomato drink (P less than 0.001). Patients were largely insensitive to HCl solutions with a titratable acidity of 1 mEq per liter or less, less than the least acidic food solution tested. However, Berstein-positive patients were still highly sensitive to infusions of coffee, orange juice, and tomato drink adjusted to pH 7 (P less than 0.001). Patients were unable to differentiate symptoms caused by acid or food infusions, and solutions did not differ in the duration of infusion needed either to cause symptoms or to relieve them by saline. We conclude that the pain of esophagitis is nonspecific and can be precipitated by variety of seemingly unrelated substances.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of intraluminal pH on motor activity of the lower esophageal body. Liquid boluses of different pH values (7 to 2) were infused in the esophagus of 14 normal subjects during manometric recording of motor activity. Each test infusion elicited an esophageal motor response, either secondary peristalsis or simultaneous contractions. Secondary peristalsis was elicited by similar volumes of perfusates at pH 7, 6, 5, but significantly less volumes were needed with perfusates pH 4, 3, and 2. Simultaneous motor activity was not affected by intraesophageal pH value in the range investigated.

New riboflavin dependent mutants of Bacillus subtilis accumulating different pteridines were studied. The data obtained show that the formation of ribityl side chain proceeds in a few steps at least on a part of riboflavin precursors. The oxidation of connected ribosyl into ribulose with subsequent restoration of it into ribityl proceeds at first. The corresponding genes are located on terminal part of riboflavin operon, as show the results of two-factor transformational crosses with different donors and recipients.

First, lymphocyte transplantation into total body-irradiated rats is discussed. The effect on spleen colony formation caused by the transplantation of untreated lymphocytes, as well as of lymphocytes previously incubated with PHA, or with PHA plus L-asparaginase, or with lymphokines, was studied. Then the effect of the urinary colony-stimulating factor in vitro, and the in vitro feeder-layer activity of leucocytes on colony formation of human and mice bone marrow cells in haematological diseases is dealth with. The injection of rat lymphocytes previously incubated for 24 hours with PHA resulted in a higher number and a larger size of colonies in the spleen of the recipient rats. Lymphocytes preincubated with lymphokines gave rise to the formation of spleen colonies which were larger than those developing after the injection of untreated lymphocytes. When the lymphocytes were previously incubated with PHA plus L-asparaginase, PHA failed to stimulate colony formation in the spleen. The phenomenon is explained by assuming that PHA, as an aspecific stimulator of cell division, initiated the division of CFUs, thus the CFUs content of the preincubated samples increased, resulting in an increase in the number of colonies formed after the transplantation of lymphocytes pretreated with PHA. Another possible explanation is that CFUs division, or their spleen take is enhanced by the immunocompetent lymphocytes activated by PHA, either directly or via soluble mediators produced or released by immunocompetent lymphocytes such as lymphokines. The study of colony-forming cells and colony-stimulating activity in primary myelofibrosis (PM) showed an increase in the number of circulating CFUc in this condition, and an abnormal density of these cells reaching a peak below 1.062. The lowering of CSA in the first two peripheral blood gradient fractions agrees with the observation in the same fractions of a high percentage of CFUc at the expense of the CSC population. Thus, double cell population seems to exist in PM. One is greatly abnormal with a low specific density and high plating efficiency, whereas the other population is almost normal, showing a higher specific density and a lower plating efficiency.

The effect of trivalent La ions on the elctrophoretic mobility of washed human platelets has been studied. The mobility of the human platelet in 0.145 M sodium chloride at pH 7.2 was -0.84 +/- 0.06 micron per sec per volt per cm with an isoelectric point approximately at pH 3.4 La3+ at a concentration corresponding to the physiological level of Ca2+ changed the sign of the electrophoretic mobility of the platelets at pH 5.5 and pH 4.0, but had only a faint or practically no effect at pH 3.0 and pH 2.0. It is assumed that La 3+ exerts its effect when bound to the phosphate groups on the surface.

Factor VIII has been isolated and purified from human granulocytes using chromatography on Sephadex G-200 AND DEAE-Sephadex A-50. The final preparation was purified 60-fold. Some properties of this partly purified factor VIII were compared with the human plasma AHF preparation. Optimum pH activity and the highest activity after incubation at different pH values was found in buffer at pH 7.0. The preparation was thermolabile and had a molecular weight of about 214,000. Absorption curves indicated that it is a protein exhibiting four fractions in polyacrylamide gel disk electrophoresis. AHF preparations from plasma and granulocytes were almost identical in the characteristics tested.

Some properties of purified endo-1,4-beta-D-xylanase (1,4-beta-D-xylan xylanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.8) from the ligniperdous fungus Trametes hirsuta were investigated. The enzyme was stable between pH 4.0 and 8.0 were optimum activity at pH 5.0--5.5. The temperature optimum was 50 degrees C and the enzyme was stable for up to 30 min at 45 degrees C; however, it was denatured at higher temperatures. The Km for 4-O-methylglucurono-D-xylan was 6.36.10(-3) equivalents of D-xylose per litre, the activation energy was 28 kJ mol-1. The molecular weight determined by means of gel chromatography was 22000--24000. The enzyme was activated by Ca2+ and inhibited by Ag+ and Hg2+. On the basis of the effect of 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide. N-bromosuccinimide and N-acetylimidazole it may be assumed that trytophan and possibly tyrosine residues influence the enzyme catalysis.

The specific use of psychotropic agents in myocardial infarction has become possible due to interdisciplinary cooperation. Especially the differentiated therapeutic application of benzodiazepine derivatives will take into better account the different psychopathologic states in the various phases. The medicamentous facilities are extended by using the central and peripheral effects of the beta-blockers. After a myocardial infarction there are various somatic and mental symptoms. This requires precise medical and psychological management with reference to a diagnostic and combined-therapeutic schedule of treatment. An intensive co-operation with all medical departments is a conditio sine qua non.

Systemic reactions after an insect bite necessitate an allergologic investigation. In addition to taking the patient's history a skin test and an estimation of allergenspecific IgE should be performed. If insect bite allergy is confirmed immediate pharmacological treatment is necessary and hyposensitization therapy is recommended. Purified venom extracts are available.

A number of case studies reveal and dynamic changes of the acid-base balance in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, such as the increasing decompensation of the metabolic lactate acidosis in the cerebrospinal fluid in lethal cases or the gradual regression in patients who were cured. Individual metabolic cerebrospinal parameters are correlated with the disturbance of consciousness. The cerebrospinal fluid parameters of patients with clouded consiciousness constitute prognostically critical values: lactate 3.6 mmol/l, pyruvate 0.19 mmol/l, pH 7.249 and bicarbonate 18.1 mmol/l. Affections of the central nervous parenchyma are better reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid than in the blood. The determination of the CSF/blood relationship of individual parameters shows a significant increase of the lactate quotient as well as a decrease of the pH quotient and of bicarbonate quotient. Respiratory parameters do not show any statistically significant changes. Statistically significant correlations show that, in the case of primary central nervous diseases, the increased hydrogen ion supply in the cerebrospinal fluid is quickly intercepted by the bicarbonate buffer and that, with a corresponding pH decrease, there is a rapid decompensation of the acid-base balance.

5 prepubertal boys with unilateral cryptorchidism and compensatory hypertrophy of the descended testicle, 22 prepubertal boys with unilateral cryptorchidism and without CTH, and 14 prepubertal normal boys were submitted to LH-RH and to HCG tests in order to study the hormonal behaviour in CTH phenomenon before puberty. High but normal peaks of plasma LH and FSH were observed after LH-RH in CTH boys who showed a significant increase of testosterone after HCG stimulation. On the contrary the LH response to LH-RH and the testosterone response to HCG of the boys with unilateral cryptorchidism and without CTH were, as expected, significantly lower than in the control ones.

A light microscopical study on a total of 812 consecutive testicular biopsies from 555 infertile men revealed intratubular changes in germ cells compatible with a carcinoma in situ pattern in six oligospermic patients (I.I%); the changes were found in both testes in two of these men. Four of the six patients developed an invasive germ cell tumour within follow-up period of 1.3 to 4.5 years. The results confirm the malignant nature of these intratubular atypical germ cells. It is concluded that testicular biopsy may be useful for early detection and cure of germ cell carcinoma in patients at risk, i.e. patients with cryptorchidism, infertile men or patients with previous cancer of one testis.

A new G6PD variant, called G6PD Vientiane, has been discovered in a patient from Laos. The characteristics of this variant are: mild enzyme deficiency (about 50% of the normal activity) in the granulocytes and the red cells, with normal G6PD-related antigen concentration; increased stability; normal Km glucose 6-phosphate and NADP+; increased inhibition constant by NADPH; decreased inhibition by ATP; slightly increased utilization of the substrate analogue; abnormal pH curve, with maximum activity at pH 9.5; slightly reduced starch gel electrophoretic migration. The implications of the molecular stability of a deficient mutant variant are discussed.

Wild-carrot (Daucus carota L.) suspension cultures grew and produced embryos on ammonium ion as a sole source of nitrogen in the absence of any exogenous Kreb's cycle acid when the pH of the medium was controlled by continuous titration with with KOH or KHCO3.

Mosquito cell cultures were initiated from the minced tissues of newly hatched Aedes dorsalis (Meigen) larvae. Continuous cell division occurred only after an adaptive period of approximately 6 months. Optimal growth of the cells required a relatively low pH of 6.5. Karyological studies showed that the cells have remained diploid (2n = 6) for 60 serial passages and that the cultures are free of contaminating cells. The cultures also were shown to be free of bacteria (including Mycoplasma), fungi and virions. Subpopulations (strains) of the original parental cultures have been selected and characterized on the basis of morphology, karyology, growth rate and monolayer formation.

gamma-Glutamyltransferase was determined in WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts and compared to enzyme levels determined in several other mammalian cell lines including: fibroblast-like cells from human skin, tibia and foreskin; epithelial-like cells from human, bovine and monkey kidney; and transformed cells (Chinese hamster ovary, HeLa S3 and SV-40 transformed WI-38). Transformed cells had the lowest activity found followed in increasing order by fibroblasts, human and bovine epithelial cells and monkey kidney epithelial cells. The enzyme isolated from the plasma membrane of WI-38 cells, like the enzyme from kidney and brain, was found to be irreversibly inhibited by iodoacetamide, reversibly by serine-borate, and had a strong specificity for certain amino acids. The possibility exists that gamma-glutamyltransferase could be involved in transport of amino acids into cells in culture; and glutamine, used in media, is an excellent substrate for the enzyme.

A filamentous alpha-hemolytic streptococcus of provisional capsular type 87 isolated from the human respiratory tract has been shown to be binary capsulated. One of the capsular antigens appears to be a glycoprotein; the other appears to be a polysaccharide. Transformation reactions with deoxyribonucleic acid from streptococcus type 87 and a number of noncapsulated pneumococci yielded transformed pneumococci with either a glycoprotein capsule or a polysaccharide capsule, but not with both. Capsular precipitin (quellung) reactions were observed when streptococcus type 87 was treated with homologous antiserum or with antisera to either of the two distinct capsular transformants. Each of the transformed pneumococci gave a quellung reaction with its homologous antiserum or with antiserum to streptococcus type 87, but neither reacted with antiserum to the heterologous transformant. Chemical analysis showed the glycoprotein antigen of streptococcus type 87 to contain, in addition to amino acids, glucose, galactose, glucosamine, and phosphate. The amino acid composition of the glycoprotein capsular antigens from streptococcus type 87 and of those from transformed pneumococci were similar, showing only minor differences. The glycoprotein capsular antigen from streptococcus type 87 gave two closely associated precipitin bands with homologous antiserum or antisera to transformed pneumococci with the glycoprotein capsule. That the two precipitin bands represent two unrelated proteins is precluded largely on the basis of the unlikely probability of 100% cotransformation of the genes coding for both proteins in the pneumococcal transformants that were isolated. Chemical analyses of the various fractions of the glycoprotein indicate that the two precipitin bands may represent a glycoprotein and its corresponding apoprotein.

The polysaccharide capsular antigen of the filamentous binary capsulated streptococcus of provisional type 87 and the polysaccharide capsular antigens of two pneumoccal strains transformed with deoxyribonucleic acid of streptococus type 87 have been purified and analyzed with regard to their component monosaccharides. The purified polysaccharides from the three strains were immunochemically identical. Each was found to contain rhamnose, glucose, galactose, galactosamine, and phosphate. Rhamnose was the immunodominant sugar.

Six enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli produced variable levels of heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) when grown under pH control at 8.5 in a simple synthetic medium containing neither amino acids nor vitamins. Bacterial growth and ST production were at levels as high as or higher than those observed in complex media. ST elaboration was detectable in the early logarithmic phase of growth and appeared to be related to disappearance of glucose in the growth medium. The results of this study did not suggest pH-dependent release of ST. Imposition of pH control in complex media resulted in increased growth rates, earlier detectable ST synthesis, and elevated levels of ST. In synthetic medium, attainment of the stationary growth phase was followed by a significant decrease in culture density and a concomitant increase in ST. Cellular autolysis experiments revealed that as much as 20% of the total ST activity was present in a cell-associated form.

We used sensitive isotopic and fluorometric assay procedures to investigate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) [NAD(P)H]oxidation in a particulate fraction derived from normal and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes. Granules isolated from normal resting cells showed allosteric kinetics with regard to oxidation of either NADH or NADPH, so that no enzyme activity was observed at physiological concentrations of substrate. If the granules were isolated from cells that had previously phagocytized zymosan, normal hyperbolic kinetics were obtained, so that activity could now be observed at low levels of substrate. The activity towards NADPH was always substantially greater than that towards NADH at any given concentration of substrate. This alteration in kinetics with phagocytosis was not observed with the other granule enzymes, acid phosphatase or beta-glucuronidase, and thus appeared to be specific for the reduced pyridine nucleotide oxidase(s). In contrast, granules isolated from cells of patients with chronic granulomatous disease showed allosteric kinetics regardless of whether they were obtained from resting or phagocytizing cells, so that NADPH oxidation was not measurable at physiological concentrations of substrate. This defect in the oxidation of NADPH by granules isolated from phagocytizing chronic granulomatous disease cells was observed over the pH range of 4.0 to 7.0. These data suggest that initiation of the respiratory burst by pahgocytosis normally requires an allosteric transformation in a reduced pyridine nucleotide oxidase, which in turn allows expression of enzymatic activity at physiological concentrations of substrate. The defect in chronic granulomatous disease appears to lie in an inability to achieve this transformation, and the enzyme remains in the inactive, allosteric form.

Lipid-free polysaccharide fraction 2 extracted from Mycoplasma pneumoniae strain FH by Prescott et al. (J. Bacteriol. 91:2117-2115, 1966) was examined for its ability to cross-precipitate antibody from type-specific rabbit antipneumococcal sera types 1 to 34 inclusive. Cross-precipitation in type-specific pneumococcal anti-type 23 and anti-type 32 sera was examined in detail and could be attributed to a rhamnose-galactose-rich component of crude M. pneumoniae polysaccharide fraction 2 recovered from immunoprecipitates formed with anti-type 23 serum. Immunochemically isolated mycoplasma polysaccharide was found to contain glucose, galactose, rhamnose, and mannose in 1:14:5:4 molar proportions. Comparison of the ability of 6-O-alpha-L-rhamnosyl-D-glucose and free L-rhamnose to inhibit precepitation by homologous pneumococcal and heterologous mycoplasma polysaccharide antigens indicates a combining site specificity for anti-type 23 and anti-type 32 antibodies directed largely against the alpha-linked L-rhamnosyl determinants and the occurrence of alpha-L-rhamnosyl units in type 32 and M. pneumoniae polysaccharides. Hapten inhibition of the cross-precipitation of pneumococcal type 23 capsular polysaccharide in anti-type 32 serum helps to establish that cross-reactivity can be attributed to interaction of recurrent, alpha-L-rhamnosyl units of type 23 with anit-alpha-L-rhamnoside combining sites of anti-type 32 antibodies.

The relationship between conditions which permit or inhibit cell lysis and those which promote phospholipid hydrolysis in Neisseria gonorrhoeae was investigated. Suspension of exponential-phase gonococci in buffer in the absence of divalent cations resulted in autolysis but not in phosphlipid hydrolysis. The addition of Ca2+ or Mg2+ to the buffer inhibited autolysis and markedly stimulated the hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine. Incubation of cells in buffer at pH 6 inhibited both autolysis and phospholipid hydrolysis.

Pulmonary washings from rabbits were freed of cells and added to the monolayers of homologous alveolar macrophages (AM). At 1 h after incubation with the pulmonary washings, many more cells adhered to glass, spread out, and showed enhanced Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction. The maximal effect of the pulmonary washings on AM activation was obtained 12 h after incubation. The AM activated by the pulmonary washings showed a higher capacity to inhibit the growth of intracellular BCG, and that capacity was correlated with the intensity of Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction by the AM. Gel filtration of the pulmonary washings through Sepharose 4B yielded five fractions. The factor that activated the AM functions was in fraction 4. When the immunoglobulin G in the fraction was removed by an immunoadsorbent column, AM activity was abolished. The effect of the immunoglobulin G was dose dependent, and minimal responses to 10(6) cells per ml were obtained at a protein concentration of 20 mug/ml. Lymphokines had no effect on AM activation with respect to the morphological alterations and Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction during the 24-h observation time. In summary, AM from normal rabbits were soon activated markedly by lavage-procured immunoglobulin G, but not by lymphokines.

We have studied a new vaccine of ribosomal nature associated with glycoprotein cell walls from Klebsiella pneumoniae which served as an immunoadjuvant. Thus vaccine was administered by the aerosol route to working men free of any important disease, especially of respiratory disease. A total of 104 men working for the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, all volunteers, were randomly placed into two groups. During the first period, 51 patients (group I) were vaccinated three times a week during 5 weeks, and the second group was used as control. During the second period, which started on day 225, the control group received the vaccine, and the first group was revaccinated. Results of this experience show a significant difference in the immunity of the two groups. The specific antibodies increased with vaccination as illustrated by chi-square test (Yates correction), which corresponds to an independent probability equal to 0 (P = 0.5 X 10-4).

In a controlled double-blind crossover trial of 5 mg mepindolol versus 80 mg propranolol, 15 mg pindolol or placebo given as single oral doses in 16 asthmatic patients, respiratory function and cardiovascular parameters were measured simultaneously. The doses chosen of the 3 active drugs were almost equipotent as shown by the similarity in the percentage fall in pulse rates at 2 hr after ingestion, although it was observed that propranolol had a different time course of effect from the 2 other beta blockers. The effect on respiratory function was marked for propranolol, with statistically significant falls in FEV1 and FEV3 at all times; mild for pindolol with lesser falls which were statistically significant only at nearly 3 hr post-ingestion; and intermediate for mepindolol. Mepindolol gave rise to a rapid and statistically significant fall in lying diastolic blood pressure compared to control values; the reductions in diastolic B. P. for propranolol or pindolol were not statistically significant compared to pretreatment control values.

The beta-blocking potency and the duration of action of trimepranol were measured in healthy volunteers using isoprenaline antagonism and reduction in exercise tachycardia. Based on isoprenaline antagonism, trimepranol was four times as potent as propranolol on a weight basis. The degree of beta blockade increased linearly with dose from 5 mg to 20 mg, excluding a dose-dependent first-pass metabolism in this dose range. There was a significnat correlation between plasma concentration and the effect of 14C-trimepranol on isoprenaline and exercise tests. The elimination half-life of trimepranol, calculated both on the basis of its effects and plasma concentrations, was approximately three to four hours. The beta blockade due to 10 or 20 mg of trimepranol was extended at least up to 12 hours following p.o. administration, based both on isoprenaline and exercise tests and on the effect of resting heart rate. Twice-a-day administration thus seems sufficient to provide a continuous beta blockade in the clinical use of trimepranol.

A multiple step-search regression procedure was applied to data obtained with 37 diazepam and 42 halazepam treated anxious outpatients. Good treatment outcome was predicted for those patients who reported a more adequate family adjustment, the presence of precipitating stress, and who either had no prior psychotropic drug treatment, or if they had received such treatment, had experienced a good response. Probably of greatest interest to the practicing clinician was the observation that patients high in initial anxiety but low in initial interpersonal problems improved the most with both medications. Differential drug effects indicated halazepam to do particularly poorly in less anxious patients and in those patients given a good prognosis by the doctor. Diazepam response was much less affected by these variables. It is speculated that the excessive sedating effect of the daily halazepam dosage (160 mg/d) used in this study may explain these differential drug effects. In the dosages employed, namely, diazepam 20 mg/d and halazepam 160 mg/d, diazepam produced the more consistent anti-anxiety effects. The indication that halazepam 160 mg/d was more effective than diazepam 20 mg/d in the initially sicker patients, while of interest, is probably simply a dose-related phenomenon, indicating that diazepam 20 mg/d was too low a daily dosage for severely anxious patients, a fact well known by most clinicians.

Since maintenance therapy with neuroleptics, lithium and tricyclic antidepressants may have to continue over extended periods of time, drug interactions between these psychotherapeutic agents and non-psychotropic treatments have become of practical clinical significance. In this paper some of the more common or important drug interactions between psychotherapeutic and non-psychotherapeutic agents are discussed.

A fluorescent analogue of propranolol, 9-AAP, was injected intravenously in order to detect beta-adrenergic receptors in the anterior segment of the albino rat eye. Specific 9-AAP fluorescence was noted along cell membranes of the ciliary epithelium and to lesser extent in the walls of blood vessels in the ciliary processes and episclera at the limbus. The iris showed maximum 9-AAP binding in the region of the sphincter muscle. These data suggest that 9-AAP may label beta receptors in the anterior segment of the rat eye.

Glycine, a putative neurotransmitter, is released into the perfused vitreous of anesthetized pigmented rats when the eye is stimulated by intermittent flashes of bright light. Other amino acids do not show stimulated release. This result provides further evidence for the role of glycine as a neural transmitter in the retina.

A 2-year-old girl affected with the late infantile form of metachromatic leukodystrophy had a persistent and moderate metabolic acidosis. Renal functional studies demonstrated the presence of decreased tubular reabsorption of sodium, bicarbonate and some amino acids. Other tubular functions, including distal urinary acidification and concentrating mechanism were normal. Glomerular filtration rate was moderately decreased. Metachromatic inclusions were demonstrated along the nephron by histochemistry and electron microscopy. Tubular dysfunction in metachromatic leukodystrophy could have been overlooked until now given the severity of the neurological picture.

Intravascular PO2 electrodes of a commercially available design were tested in vitro to establish their characteristics and to further elucidate on their clinical usability. In addition, four different cathode-anode combinations, utilizing the same geometrical design, were evaluated to establich the best combination. Au-Ag/AgCl exhibited the best characteristics as verified by the evaluation of stabilization time, sensitivity and reproducibility of the response, response time, linearity, drift, effects of temperature, flow, and pH, and the useful life of the sensors. Even though the Au-Ag/AgCl combination exhibited the best characteristics, it fell far below clinically recommended criteria for continuous monitoring of less than 10 Torr/24 h.

Using a 14C-labeled DMO, 36Cl and 3H method, we have determined the in vivo buffering capacity of lung, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, and extracellular fluid (ECF) of guinea pigs during hypercapnia (FICO2 = 0.15). After 1 days' exposureto 15% CO2, both the relative CO2 buffer values (delta HCO3/deltapH) and the "%pH regulation" were lung greater than kidney greater than heart greater than ECF greater than skeletal muscle. For lung tissue the intracellular pH was significantly decreased only during acute (8 h) hypercapnia and had completely returned to control values after 7 days with arterial PCO2 congruent to 122 Torr. Kidney and cardiac muscle also showed ca. 100% regulation of pH at 7 days, whereas skeletal muscle and ECF showed only 80 and 70% pH regulation, respectively. The results are discussed with respect to the important (and pH-dependent) metabolic functions of the lung and kidney.

Studies were carried out during fetal life in sheep to determine the relationship of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), the intracellular red cell and extracellular pH, and the switchover to adult hemoglobin synthesis in regulating the position of the fetal red cell oxygen-affinity curve in utero. Adult hemoglobin first appeared near 120 days of gestation. The mean oxygen tension at which hemoglobin is half saturated (P50) prior to 120 days of gestation remained constant at 13.9 +/- 0.3 (SD) Torr and then increased gradually as gestation continued, reaching 19 Torr at term. During the interval of fetal life studied, the level of DPG was 4.43 +/- 1.63 (SD) micromol/g Hb and the deltapH between plasma and red blood cells was 0.227 +/- 0.038 (SD); neither was affected by gestational age. The decrease in the red cell oxygen affinity after 120 days of gestation ocrrelated with the amount of adult hemoglobin present in the fetus (r = 0.78; P less than 0.001). This decrease can be attributed only to the amount of the adult-type hemoglobin present, and not to DPG, or to changes in the deltapH between plasma and red blood cells, because both remained stable during the last trimester.

An experimental teaching procedure was devised and tested for integrating the nursing process, nursing care plans, the research process and management principals. The integration defined as the problem oriented process (POP) was tested with 16 students over two semesters. The results indicated that the POP was a successful integration that aided the student in "getting it all together." As one of the students put it: This experience will give future students, as it did me, a better understanding of how research is best utilized. The students can use almost all their past learning experiences, bringing it all together in one situation. He (the student) can use his communication skills to detect a problem, his research skills to design  planned intervention and evaluation and his interpersonal skills to measure his effectiveness as a change agent. Finally, he can use his nursing skills and knowledge of pathophysiology in a setting most like what he will find upon graduation.

Curriculum development is many things; it is the study of impact on students, a process through which faculty are moving. It usually does not represent a final decision- like all issues in higher education it is altered as different people and issues arise. The integrated curriculum movement in nursing, while a seminal change, has in a way been like a shadow- incompletely described with lack of clarity about base for comparison. It seems to have become the mode for many schools to develop their own conceptual frameworks and curricular plans. While adaptation to the local setting is expected, one must question how much of the total development effort is necessary and due in part to lack of fully developed curriculum models and dissemination and not building systematically toward improvement in the field. In such a situation we all may be making the same mistakes. If these identified "problems" are indeed just that, they all are amenable to correction. Each solution will require hard conceptual work.

Seductive behavior seen in the convalescent individual is generally a signal that the patient is in the process of assessment. It is not a social invitation to sexual activity. The patient is merely trying to reassess his situation after having experienced an illness, injury or surgery. Nurses have an obligation to be informed regarding the effects of illness on sexuality, and an obligation to recognize the patient's seductive signals. Nurses need to recognize the mechanics of seductive behavior and be able to qualify the behavior in order to help the patient express his/her concerns during convalescence. Finally, nurses have an obligation to discover or create referral sources in their local area where patients may seek help with their altered sexual function, should that be warranted.

1-N HAPA gentamicin B is a new aminoglycoside active against most Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Among 504 clinical isolates at a concentration of 12.5 microgram/ml all Staph. aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia and 78% of Pseudomonas, 86% of Proteus morganii were inhibited. Like other aminoglycosides, the activity was greatest at an alkaline ph and reduced by high cations concentrations. 1-N HAPA gentamicin B was equal in activity to amikacin against both gentamicin-sensitive and resistant isolates. It inhibited bacteria containing many of the aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes. When combined with carbenicillin it inhibited in a synergistic manner many Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas and Serratia.

Antibiotic M-4365G2 (de-epoxy rosamicin) produced by Micromonospora capillata MCRL 0940 is a new basic 16-membered macrolide antibiotic with activity equal to or superior to erythromycin and josamycin against Gram-positive bacteria. Of interest are the high degree of activity against Gram-negative bacilli and mycoplasmas, and striking inhibitory effects against indole-producing Proteus spp. Bactericidal activity of M-4365G2 is also to be noticed.

The symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing bacterium Rhizobium sp. 32H1 is a specialized ammonium producer during symbiosis. However, during free-living growth, Rhizobium 32H1 assimilates ammonium very poorly. Two pathways of ammonium assimilation exist in enteric bacteria. One is mediated by glutamate dehydrogenase, and the other is mediated by glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase. The former pathway is altogether inoperative in Rhizobium 32H1; the latter pathway operates at a slow rate and is under strict negative control by ammonium itself. Rhizobium 32H1 glutamine synthetase activity is modulated by both repression-derepression and reversible adenylylation. For a biochemical process lacking an alternative pathway, such a regulatory pattern exacerbates the very process. This suggests that Rhizobium 32H1 restricts its own ammonium assimilation to maximize the contribution of fixed nitrogen to the host plant during symbiosis.

An enzyme (splitting enzyme 2) which catalyzes the splitting of carbon-mercury linkage of arylmercury compounds was found in extracts of mercury-resistant Pseudomonas K-62. This enzyme was purified about 725-fold by treatment with streptomycin, precipitation with ammonium sulfate, and successive chromatography on Sephadex G-75 and diethylaminoethyl-cellulose. A purified preparation of the enzyme showed a single band in electrophoresis either on polyacrylamide or sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing polyacrylamide gels. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 20,000 (determined by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration) 17,000 (determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis). The enzyme showed a Km of 180 micron and a Vmax of 3.1 mumol/min per mg for p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and a Km of 250 micron and a Vmax of 20 mumol/min per mg for phenylmercuric acetate. The optimum temperature and pH for the reaction were 40 degrees C and 5.0, respectively.

Alcohol-oxidizing enzymes of the facultative methylotroph PAR were investigated after growth of the bacteria on methanol and ethanol. During methanol growth only a phenazine methosulfate-linked alcohol dehydrogenase was detected. This enzyme had broad specificity for primary alcohols and was also capable of oxidation of secondary alcohols. It had a molecular weight of 112,000, was composed of two subunits of equal molecular weight, and showed an absolute requirement for ammonium ion for activation. During ethanol growth this enzyme was absent and was replaced by a typical nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked alcohol dehydrogenase of molecular weight 150,000. The latter enzyme also had broad specificity but could not oxidize methanol. This enzyme was not found during methanol growth. These data show that the organism has two distinctly separate mechanisms for oxidation of alcohols.

We have assayed the ability of various lipids to affect DNA polymerases activity in a DNA-membrane complex extracted from Streptococcus pneumoniae by the Sarkosyl-M-band technique. In addition, to determine which DNA polymerases were affected by the lipids, we partially purified three DNA polymerase activities from cell lysates, the first such demonstration outside of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Glycolipids are unique among polar lipids in stimulating the rate and extent of DNA polymerase activity in M-bands and in Sarkosyl lysates from which the M-band is derived. It appears that they exert this stimulatory effect, in part, by removing (neutralizing) detergent molecules which act as inhibitors, as well as by substituting for the detergent, thereby creating a favorable environment for the polymerases involved in DNA synthesis. That the stimulatory effect is not simply a detoxification of the detergent was shown by two observations. One, phospholipids, although interacting with Sarkosyl and therefore "potentially" capable of detoxifying the system, did not stimulate DNA polymerase activity in vitro. Two, glycolipids were capable of stimulating the activity of at least two DNA polymerases partially purified from cell lysates in the absence of any Sarkosyl. The stimulatory effect was greater for a polymerase that had four characteristics similar to those observed with polymerase III in other organisms.

The nature of the intermediate-affinity (n2) Mn(II) binding sites in glutamine synthetase [EC 6.3.1.2] has been studied as a function of adenylylation in a variety of enzyme-metal complexes by EPR. In the absence of nucleotide the n2 Mn(II) environment is nearly isotropic, the Mn(II) bonds are highly ionic, and the interaction distance R greater than or equal to 12-14 A. Nucleotide binding at the n2 Mn(II) site renders the n2 Mn(II) signal unobservable and causes a reduction in signal amplitude (approximately 30%) and line broadening (approximately 6 G) at the high-affinity (n1) Mn(II) site. This behavior indicates that nucleotide binding induces a conformational change in the enzyme which brings the previously distant n1 and n2 sites into closer proximity (R less than or equal to 8-11 A), possibly for the purpose of activating the nucleotide for direct phosphoryl transfer to L-glutamate. In line with this suggestion, the broad, unresolved resonances in complexes containing both L-methionine SR-sulfoximine (MSOX) and nucleotide may result from the phosphorylation of MSOX. The n2 Mn(II) site is not affected by adenylylation in all the enzyme-metal complexes studied, which suggests that the regulatory effects of adenylylation may only act at the n1 Mn(II) sites.

Conditions have been investigated for the use of fluorescamine-labeled casein as a substrate for fluorometric assay of proteinases. Fluorescamine-labeled casein can be prepared simply by mixing solutions of casein and fluorescamine at pH 8.0 and used without removal of the excess reagent or its hydrolysis product. The fluorescence of the labeled casein and its enzymatic digest is moderately stable in the range of pH 7.0 to 10.0. Activities can be determined by measuring the fluorescence of the hydrolysis products soluble in 0.1 M trichloro acetic acid solution at pH 4.0 after adjusting the pH of the acid-soluble fraction to 7.7. This method is suited for assay of proteinases active at neutral to slightly alkaline pH values, and is capable of quantitating about 0.05 microgram of trypsin or 0.5 microgram of alpha-chymotrypsin or papain. The assay can be done in the presence of large amounts of contaminating amino acid, protein and/or exopeptidases which may interfere with the ordinary assay of proteinases.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase in rat liver homogenates was activated in vitro in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. The activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in rat liver preparations was determined in a 1-min assay to preclude the possibility of citrate activation of the enzyme during the assay period. Activation of the enzyme occurred more rapidly in liver preparations continuously maintained at ambient or greater temperatures than in homogenates of liver which had been chilled. High speed supernatant (105,000 X g, 60 min) did not heat-activate, and reconstitution of the heat-activatable 27,000 X g, 20-min, fraction by recombining the high speed pellet with the high speed supernatant only partially restored the heat activatability. Elution of the 105,000 X g supernatant from Sephadex G-25 resulted in an enzyme preparation which was heat-activatable. Addition of boiled 105,000 X g supernatant to the Sephadex G-25-treated enzyme again prevented heat activation. Dilution of the enzyme 5-fold did not prevent heat activation.

Transglutaminases were found to catalyze the formation of cross-links between peptide chains by means of a transfer reaction between the carboxamide group of a glutamine residue in each chain and both primary amino groups of a diamine or a polyamine. Production of this heretofore undescribed linkage by guinea pig liver transglutaminase was demonstrated by the use of high performance liquid chromatography in a model system using glutamine peptide derivatives and a variety of diamines and polyamines. Evidence for intermolecular cross-linking through polyamines with both the liver enzyme and thrombin-activated human plasma blood coagulation factor XIII was obtained by the use of a guanidinated derivative of beta-casein.

Catechol estrogens, the 2-hydroxylated metabolites of estrogens, recently shown to be formed in brain, inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the pivotal step in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine. The nature of the inhibition is by competition with the pterin cofactor and thus resembles feedback inhibition of the enzyme by catecholamines.

The pH dependence of kcat/Km for the papain-catalyzed hydrolysis of ethyl hippurate, N-alpha-benzoyl-L-citrulline methyl ester, and the p-nitroanilide, amide, and ethyl ester derivatives of N-alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine was determined below pH 6.4. The value of kcat/Km was observed to be modulated by two acid ionizations rather than a single ionization as previously believed. For the five substrates studied, the average pK values for the two ionizations are 3.78 +/- 0.2 and 3.95 +/- 0.1 at T/2 0.3, 25 degrees C. The observation that similar pK values were obtained with different substrates was taken as evidence that the kinetically determined pK values are close in value to true macroscopic ionization constants for ionization of groups on the free enzyme.

The oxidation-reduction potential values for the two electron transfers to glucose oxidase were obtained at pH 5.3, where the neutral radical is the stable form, and at pH 9.3, where the anion radical is the stable form. The midpoint potentials at 25 degrees were: pH 5.3 EFl1ox + e- H+ equilibrium EFlH. Em1 = -0.063 +/- 0.011 V EFlH. + e- + H+ equilibrium EFlredH2 Em2 = -0.065 +/- 0.007 V pH 9.3 EFlox + e- EFi- Em1 = -0.200 +/- 0.010 V EFi- + e- + H+ equilibrium EFlredH- Em2 = -0.240 +/- 0.005 V All potentials were measured versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The potentials indicated that glucose oxidase radicals are stabilized by kinetic factors and not by thermodynamic energy barriers. The pK for the glucose oxidase radical was 7.28 from dead time stopped flow measurements and the extinction coefficient of the neutral semiquinone was 4140 M-1 cm-1 at 570 nm. Both radical forms reacted with oxygen in a second order fashion. The rate at 25 degrees for the neutral semiquinone was 1.4 X 10(4) M-1 s-1; that for the anion radical was 3.5 X 10(4) M-1 s-1. The rate of oxidation of the neutral radical changed by a factor of 9 for a temperature difference of 22 degrees. For the anion radical, the oxidation rate changed by a factor of 6 for a 22 degrees change in temperature. We studied the oxygen reactivity of the 2-electron reduced form of the enzyme over a wide wavelength range and failed to detect either oxygenated flavin derivatives or semiquinoid forms as intermediates. The rate of reoxidation of fully reduced glucose oxidase at pH 9.3 was dependent on ionic strength.

When chick liver cells in monolayer culture were incubated with 32Pi in the presence of insulin, acetyl-CoA carboxylase became extensively labeled with 32Pi reaching a stoichiometry of 9 to 10 mol of phosphoryl group per mol of 240,000-dalton enzyme subunit. The covalently bound phosphate was found to be metabolically labile, turning over with a t1/2 of approximately 2 h (enzyme t1/2 approximately equal to 24 h). Addition of Bt2cAMP altered neither the rate nor extent of phosphorylation. Contrary to other reports, the fully phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase appears to be catalytically active.

The activity of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase has been shown to be high in both mesenteric arteries and veins; the present study suggests that it may be responsible for the inactivation of prostacyclin (PGI2). The cytoplasmic fractions of bovine mesenteric arteries and veins were incubated with radiolabeled PGI2 in the presence of NAD+ or NADP+. The substrate was rapidly converted to a product, which was isolated and identified as 6,15-diketo prostaglandin F1alpha, (6,15-diketo-PGF1alpha) by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The initial reaction rate began to level off after less than 1 min of incubation at 37 degrees C. When radiolabeled 6-keto-PGF1alpha, the stable hydrolysis product of PGI2, was used as substrate under the same conditions, 97% was recovered unmetabolized after 2 min of incubation. Catabolism of PGI2 may be a major determinant of its levels in blood vessels and, therefore, may be of crucial importance to regulating the action of PGI2. Further, estimation of PGI2 generation by either tissues or organs may be misleading if only 6-keto-PGF1alpha is measured.

The conformation of the outer surface of the human red cell membrane has been studied under various conditions using the impermeant probe [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid. At least seven polypeptides were labeled by the reagent, including the three extractable glycoproteins separable by the electrophoretic method employed. The Mr = 43,000 protein band was shown to contain two labeled species, one a glycoprotein, in addition to its major constituent, red cell actin. The extent and pattern of labeling were very sensitive to changes in pH and temperature. Total labeling increased with increasing pH and was greater at 4 degrees C than 37 degrees C. Binding of the probe to the Mr = 90,000 polypeptide and the major glycoprotein were relatively increased with increasing pH and temperature while opposite effects were observed for the Mr = 43,000 peptide(s). The pH effects on external membrane labeling were rapidly reversible. Results were similar in cells of different densities, suggesting that the pH and temperature effects were not related to cell age. The data presented emphasize the lability of membrane conformation and reactivity and thus the necessity to consider carefully the conditions of labeling in interpretation of studies using impermeant probes.

The effect of solvent conditions on the conformation of rabbit Clq was studied by both spectroscopic and nonspectroscopic methods. The conformation of Clq in buffered saline solutions at pH 7.4 or 6.0 did not differ significantly from Clq at twice the saline concentration as determined with circular dichroism, difference spectroscopy, and tritium-hydrogen exchange techniques. Addition of calcium to the buffers had no structural effects in any of the conditions examined. Hydrogen exchange experiments performed at pH 7.4 were also unaffected by magnesium, manganese, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. With all the methods used a pH effect was observable between 5.1 and 8.3. From solvent perturbation difference spectroscopy results it was calculated that the equivalent of 10 +/- 2 and 6 +/- 1 mol of tyrosine and tryptophan/mol of Clq, respectively, became exposed at the lower pH. A small positive CD band in the 231 to 235 nm region decreased in wavelength and increased in magnitude as a function of decreasing pH, indicating tyrosine exposure at the lower pH and possibly changes in the collagen-like structure of Clq. Hydrogen exchange experiments indicate a small, but significant, conformation transition occurring in the pH 5 region and a stabilization of conformation between pH 6 to 8. From these results the conformational pH dependence was interpreted as an acid expansion of Clq with a minor conformational transition occurring between pH 5 AND 6. These effects may in part be associated with decreased Clq-Ig interactions which have been observed at the lower pH.

Leghemoglobin(IV), the derivative of leghemoglobin at the formal oxidation state IV, when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature exhibits radically different spectra at acid and alkaline pH. The acid and alkaline forms are freely interconvertible. The optical spectrum of the acid form is closely similar to optical spectra of the red higher oxidation states of horseradish and cytochrome c peroxidases, showing that the configuration of the heme iron is the same throughout this family of compounds. That configuration is believed to be Fe(IV) in a porphyrin environment. The optical spectrum of the alkaline form of leghemoglobin(IV) recalls that of alkaline low spin ferric leghemoglobin. Near infrared spectra of leghemoglobin(IV), myoglobin(IV), and the higher oxidation states of the peroxidases are featureless to 1300 nm, suggesting a common structural feature. The acid form of leghemoglobin(IV), seen in fluid buffer as a transient species at pH 5 or less, is conveniently generated by cooling a solution of the more stable alkaline form in borate buffer to liquid nitrogen temperature. At this temperature borate buffers become acid.

Myoglobin(IV), the derivative of myoglobin at the formal oxidation state IV, prepared from kangaroo (Megaleia rufa), horse, or sperm whale myoglobin, when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature, assumes acid and alkaline forms with different optical spectra. The essential features of the optical spectra of the acid forms are the same as those of leghemoglobin(IV) and are very similar to those of optical spectra of the red higher oxidation states of catalases and peroxidases. This shows that the configuration of the heme iron is the same throughout these compounds. That configuration is believed to be Fe(IV) in a porphyrin environment. The optical spectra of alkaline mammalian myoglobin(IV), like that of alkaline leghemoglobin(IV), resemble those of the alkaline low spin ferric proteins. Kangaroo myoglobin(IV) may be prepared by reaction of ferrous myoglobin with hydrogen peroxide. The acid forms of myoglobin(IV) are conveniently prepared by cooling solutions in borate buffers, initially pH 8.3, to liquid nitrogen temperature. At this temperature borate buffers become acidic.

The molecular structure of chick embryo fibroblast cell surface protein has been investigated by ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism, and fluorescence. Most measurements were restricted to alkaline solutions because of the limited solubility of this protein at more neutral pH values. A very high frictional ratio for the protein suggests an asymmetric structure. However, there are elements of organized structure since typical thermal transition curves were found by several methods. Consequently, a model in which ordered domains are connected by flexible polypeptide chains seems to account for all the hydrodynamic and optical data.

Symptoms resembling those of plantar fasciitis were seen in six athletes who were thought to have a partial rupture of the plantar fascia. Treatment, which included the use of crutches, anti-inflammatory agents, strapping of the arch, and ice packs, was successful in all but one patient who had a painful mass in the area of the previous rupture. After surgical excision of the painful mass and release of the fascia, he recovered. Five of the six athletes had been previously treated with repeated local injections of steroid.

We have established a continous cell line (G1) in which the tyrosine hydroxylase specific activity is increased as much as 50-100-fold in response to dexamethasone. This response is specific for the glucocorticoid class of steroid hormones; it is elicited by dexamethasone, corticosterone, and triamcinolone, but not by estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, or deoxycorticosterone acetate. The increase in tyrosine hydroxylase specific activity is likely to be due to the increased synthesis of new enzyme protein rather than an activation of existing protein molecules, inasmuch as this increase is completely blocked by cycloheximide.

The inhibition of glucose transport by the non-ionizable local-anesthetic denzylalcohol is of the mixed type and independent of pH. The affinity of benzylalcohol to the free carrier is about three times larger than that to the carrier-glucose complex.

Growth characteristics of Euglena gracilis Z as functions of culture pH, CO2 tension, temperature, and lighting regime were investigated. The results are consistent with the possibility that cell division is preceded by a lowered intracellular pH. Also consistent with this possibility is the finding that division rhythmicity can be induced by periodic changes in CO2 tension. It is suggested that the rhythmicity is induced by changes in intracellular pH produced by carbonic acid.

The fibrinolytic activity of cells in culture varied with the type of serum employed in the growth medium. Degradation of iodinated fibrin occurred slowly when Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts were grown in medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), and rapidly when chicken serum was employed. This difference reflected the low plasminogen and high inhibitor content of FBS. The inhibitors were found to be serum macromolecules that were precipitated with ammonium sulfate or polyethylene glycol, and were inactivated by boiling or upon exposure to acidic conditions. No inhibitor activity was detected in fetuin, one of the major proteins present in FBS. Acidified FBS was similar to chicken serum in that both supported high rates of cell-mediated fibrinolytic activity. Although virally transformed hamster, mouse and chicken cells grew well in acid-treated FBS, their normal counterparts did not. Apparently, acifification resulted in the formation of materials that were toxic to normal cells. These agents rapidly blocked cellular DNA synthesis.

The effect of methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg per day given parenterally for 3 doses, 2 wk or 12 wk) on the permeability of mammalian gastric mucosa to hydrogen ion (H(+)) was examined with denervated fundic pouches in dogs with antrectomies. Transmucosal electric potential difference (PD) and net fluxes of H(+) and Na(+) were determined for luminal [H(+)] from 20 to 160 mM and [Na(+)] from 1 to 140 mM ([H(+)] and [Na(+)] were varied reciprocally). The PD was 50-60 mV lumen negative and was constant over the entire range of Na(+) and H(+) concentration tested. Net H(+) flux varied linearly with [H(+)]. Extrapolation indicated apparent H(+) loss at zero luminal concentration, suggesting a basal HCO(3) (-) secretion. Addition of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or taurocholate decreased the PD to 30-40 mV and increased threefold the slope of the relation between net H(+) flux and [H(+)] (k(H)). Calculation of PD-independent permeability constants for H(+) (P(H)) with the Goldman constant field equation indicated that this increase in k(H) could not be attributed solely to the associated decrease in PD. Prednisolone administered for 3 doses had no effect on either the basal mucosal permeability to H(+) or the altered permeability induced by ASA or taurocholate. Chronic administration induced a low rate of basal acid secretion (at 12 wk) but had no effect on either PD or k(H). However, the increase in k(H) and P(H) that developed upon addition of ASA or taurocholate in chronically treated dogs was more than one and a half times that of controls. These data suggest that prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids increases susceptibility of the gastric mucosa to damage by agents that increase permeability to H(+).

Previous studies in vivo and with isolated perfused rat livers have suggested that the deleterious effect of ethanol on hepatic pyridoxal 5'-phosphate metabolism is mediated by acetaldehyde. Inasmuch as acetaldehyde has no effect on the synthesis of pyridoxal phosphate, it has also been postulated that acetaldehyde accelerates pyridoxal phosphate degradation by displacing this coenzyme from binding proteins, which protect it against hydrolysis. To test these hypotheses, studies have been performed with isolated rat hepatocytes, subcellular fractions of rat liver, and human erythrocytes. Ethanol oxidation lowered the pyridoxal phosphate content of isolated liver cells when acetaldehyde oxidation was inhibited by either disulfiram or prior treatment of rats with cyanamide. Additions of 7.5 mM acetaldehyde alone at 40-min intervals to cell suspensions decreased hepatic pyridoxal phosphate content only slightly because acetaldehyde was rapidly metabolized. However, when acetaldehyde oxidation and reduction were inhibited by cyanamide treatment and by 4-methyl-pyrazole and isobutyramide, respectively, a 40% decrease in hepatic pyridoxal phosphate content was observed in 80 min of incubation. In equilibrium dialysis experiments, acetaldehyde, 7.5 and 15 mM, displaced protein-bound pyridoxal phosphate in undialyzed hepatic cytosol and in hemolysate supernate containing added pyridoxal phosphate. In the presence of alkaline phosphatase, acetaldehyde accelerated the degradation of pyridoxal phosphate in dialyzed hemolysate supernate and hepatic cytosol with added pyridoxal phosphate. Acetaldehyde also inhibits tyrosine aminotransferase. The kinetics of inhibition were mixed competitive-noncompetitive with respect to pyridoxal phosphate. These observations support the hypothesis that the deleterious effect of ethanol oxidation on pyridoxal phosphate metabolism is mediated at least in part by acetaldehyde which displaces this coenzyme from protein binding, thereby enhancing its degradation.

In the erythrocytes of a patient with hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, a homozygous expression of hexokinase deficiency was detected. The mutant enzyme was characterized by normal kinetic parameters with respect to its substrates, glucose and MgATP2-, normal pH optimum, normal heat stability at 40 degrees C, but abnormal behavior with respect to its regulation by glucose-1,6-diphosphate and inorganic phosphate, and an altered electrophoretic pattern. Interpretation of the results revealed the presence of two different hexokinases type I in normal human erythrocytes: one enzyme with a high affinity for glucose-1,6-diphosphate, the inhibition of which is regulated by inorganic phosphate; and another enzyme with a lower affinity for the inhibitor, not regulated by inorganic phosphate. The former enzyme was not detectable in the erythrocytes of the patient, whereas the presence of the latter enzyme could be demonstrated.

To investigate the role of immunologic hypersensitivity to collagen in the causation of type II collagen-induced arthritis in rats, passive transfer experiments were performed. Wistar/Lewis rats used in these experiments were demonstrated to be histocompatible by prolonged skin graft survival and mixed lymphocyte cultures. Popliteal lymph node weight assays excluded a potential for graft-vs.-host reactivity in this strain. 9 of 32 naive rats developed arthritis after intravenous receipt of pooled spleen and lymph node cells from donors that had been injected intradermally with type II collagen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. This passively transferred synovitis was evident clinically as well as histologically. In control cell transfer experiments involving a total of 97 recipients, transfer of arthritis was shown to require viable cells sensitized to type II collagen. These controls included 17 rats receiving cells from unimmunized donors, 20 recipients of cells from donors injected with incomplete Freund's adjuvant alone, and 24 recipients of cells from rats injected with type I collagen in adjuvant. Deliberate addition of solubilized type II collagen to unsensitized cells at the time of transfer or injection of heat-killed sensitized cells also did not cause arthritis in a total of 36 recipients. These latter two control groups indicate that disease transfer was not the result of antigen carry-over. Intravenous injection of sera from arthritic donors was incapable of passively transferring clinical or histologic synovitis in 30 recipients. Thus, these studies directly implicate immunologic sensitivity to the cartilage type of collagen in the etiology of this autoimmune disease.

We have investigated the effect of hypocomplementemia on early pulmonary clearance of four species of bacteria. The experiments were performed in an inbred animal model to minimize immunologic variability. Complement was depleted by cobra venom factor, and activity in serum was monitored with a phagocytic assay. Bacterial specific antibodies were examined by an indirect radioimmunoassay, and animals with high levels of activity were excluded from anaysis. 4 h after aerosolization with Streptococcus pneumoniae, complement-depleted animals had cleared only 75% of the initial number of organisms, whereas saline-treated controls cleared 91% (P less than 0.01). Aerosolization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was followed at 4 h by a twofold greater growth of organisms in the complement-depleted animals (446% of original deposition) as compared to the saline-treated controls (211% of original deposition) (P less than 0.02). Clearance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were similar in complement-depleted animals and saline-treated controls. These experiments suggest that hypocomplementemia predisposes to bacterial pneumonia and may explain the high incidence of pulmonary infections in patients having impaired complement activity. Our results further indicate that varying defense mechanisms may be involved with clearing the lung of differing bacterial species.

The effect of alpha adrenergic block-ade on coronary blood flow regulation at rest was studied in 11 normally innervated patients and 8 cardiac allograft recipients by measuring arterial pressure and coronary sinus blood flow by thermodilution before and after alpha adrenergic blockade with phentolamine. Coronary vascular resistance was calculated by using coronary sinus blood flow and mean arterial pressure, and metabolic demand was estimated by the product of systolic arterial pressure and heart rate. In addition, the coronary sinus blood flow response to tachycardia was examined in 9 innervated patients and 12 denervated patients, with measurements repeated after phentolamine in 8 of the 9 innvervated patients and 6 of the 12 denervated patients. There was a 7.3+/-4.4% increase in coronary sinus blood flow in the innervated patients in response to alpha blockade, whereas the transplanted patients had an 8.2+/-1.8% fall in coronary sinus blood flow, despite equivalent changes in rate pressure product. The innervated patients also demonstrated a significantly greater increase in coronary sinus blood flow than did the transplanted patients during the first 5 s of an abrupt increase in heart rate (26+/-4 vs. 8+/-2.5 ml/min, P <0.001). This early response was blunted after alpha adrenergic blockade. We conclude that there is basal alpha adrenergic tone present on the coronary vasculature in man that is withdrawn by a sudden increase in heart rate.

The gamma-glutamyl transferase isoenzymes of bile were studied using electrophoretic, gel filtration, and ultracentrifugation techniques. In view of the known association of other biliary enzymes with lipids the effects of butanol extraction were investigated. The results show the presence of four isoenzymes of gamma-glutamyl transferase in bile, differing in electrophoretic mobilities, molecular size, and density. The correlation between the properties of biliary gamma-glutamyl transferase and of alkaline phosphatase is discussed.

As can be seen from the tables, the terminal half-life of clobazam is about 50 hours, and from a solid dosage form the peak plasma level occurs approximately 1.5 hours after ingestion. Thus, there is a significant, yet relatively short, dosage form delay effect when the solid dosage forms are compared to the rapidly available solution of the drug. However, based on the areas under the curve, comparison of the solid dosage forms with the solution indicates that the fraction of clobazam absorbed is 1. Pupil diameter measurement at 2, 4, and 6 hours after ingestion of clobazam correlated well with the plasma levels at these times. Pupils were constricted to the highest degree at 2 hours and approached the initial pupillary diameter at the 6-hour measurement.

Clobazam, a new antianxiety compound, was compared in a double-blind study  with diazepam in 40 neurotic outpatients. Twenty-three patients completed the trial under clobazam conditions while 17 patients completed the trial under diazepam conditions. The trial was conducted for a period of four weeks of active drug administration followed by a one-week period of placebo administration. Clobazam was administered in three divided doses of 30 to 40 mg/day, while diazepam was administered in three divided doses of 15 to 20 mg/day, following a fixed dosage schedule. No significant differences were noted between the two treatment conditions during the drug trial period. The patients on clobazam maintained greater improvement during the placebo trial period for the variables "somatic anxiety" and "nights of sleep disturbance." Simultaneous motor coordination tests (hand steadiness test) showed greater improvement on clobazam throughout the trial period in patients with an initial error score greater than 50 points. This difference was significant during the second week of the trial.

All 47 non-nisin producing strains of Streptococcus lactis and 12/13 strains of Str. lactis subsp. diacetylactis examined produced bacteriocins, for which the term lactostrepcins is suggested. Seven strains of Str. cremoris examined produced no bacteriocins active against 3 lactic streptococci strains used as indicators. The strains examined were divided into 3 groups: I, those producing lactostrepcins active against only one streptomycin resistant mutant of Str. lactis 60 indicator strain; II, those producing lactostrepcins active against all 3 indicator strains; III, those not producing lactostrepcins active against the indicator strains employed. The lactostrepcins were sensitive to various proteolytic enzymes and to phospholipase D, but retained full or partial activity after dialysis. Most of the bacteriocins studied were fully active only within the pH range 4.2--5.0 and were reversibly inactivated at pH 7.0 or 8.0. Results suggested occurrence of 4 different lactostrepcins. The lactostrepcins produced by all group I strains were the same, but there were differences among the lactostrepcins produced by group II strains. Lactostrepcins killed some beta-haemolytic streptococci and some strains of Lactobacillus helveticus. One of the lactostrepcins was also active against certain Leuconostoc strains, but not against other Leuconostoc strains, nor against L. helveticus or other Gram-positive bacteria.

In five male and five female calves, we studied the tissue distribution of gamma-glutamyl transferase. The enzyme was mainly in kidney, pancreas, and liver; there was no sex-related difference. The relative hepatic and pancreatic specificity of the enzyme indicated that the measure of its activity in serum could be a test of hepatic or pancreatic damage in the calf. Serum activity measured within 159 samples of apparently healthy calves was 15.3 +/- 3.7 U/liter, not differing significantly from that of adult cow.

Until recent years, nutrition has received little attention in U.S. agriculture, food, and health policies. This circumstance is changing. In the late sixties and early seventies, reports of hunger and malnutrition sparked public reaction and a shift in policy. The White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health in 1971 prompted the Senate select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs to address itself to this problem, with the result that the Food Stamp, child nutrition, WIC, and Nutrition for the Elderly programs were initiated or expanded. Then, in the mid-seventies, the Select Committee turned its attention to broader issues of nutrition and health and declared that the goal of any food system is the maintenance and improvement of nutritional health of the population. This objective emerged as public policy in the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977. As the Select Committee continued its work, problems of overnutrition became more apparent. The culmination of its studies was the issuance early in 1977 of the "Dietary Goals for the United States," designed to improve the nutrition and reduce health problems of the population. To that same end, the Select Committee has also made recommendations regarding food labeling and nutrition education.

In a four-week study, a comparison was made of oxazepam, flurazepam and chloral hydrate as hypnotic sedatives in 17 geriatric patients. Each drug was given alone for six nights, with a two-night placebo interval following each phase. Each patient completed an additional placebo phase (up to six nights) before each drug phase. The number of awakenings per night and the sleep latency (time required to fall asleep) were determined from the patients' reports and from the reports of a nurse-observer. Only for oxazepam was the number of patient-reported awakenings per night significantly less than for placebo, although with both oxazepam and flurazepam the awakenings were fewer than with chloral hydrate. According to the patient-reports, sleep latency was significantly lower with flurazepam than with placebo; for oxazepam and chloral hydrate the latencies were not significantly different from those for flurazepam or placebo. Only for oxazepam were the patients' ratings of sleep quality significantly greater than for placebo. The objective assessment of sleep by the nurse-observer usually confirmed the patients' assessments. Morning drowsiness was the most common side effect, reported equally for placebo and for the active drugs. Drowsiness during the day was reported less frequently for oxazepam than for flurazepam, chloral hydrate or placebo. It is concluded that oxazepam is safe and efficacious for the short-term management of insomnia in the elderly.

Intravenous injection of New Zealand White rabbits with type III pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine conjugated with the cardiac glycoside digoxin resulted in the production of both antidigoxin and anti-type III pneumococcal polysacharide antibodies. Among antisera of 12 rabbits examined during their peak antibody production periods, 1 to 20 mg (mean, 5.4 mg) of antidigoxin antibody could be recovered from 1 ml of serum. Antisera from five of these 12 rabbits contained antidigoxin antibodies of restricted heterogeneity as demonstrated by urea-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis of fully reduced and alkylated antibodies. From the antisera of four of these five rabbits, electrophoretically homogeneous antibodies (1 to 5 mg/ml antiserum) could be isolated by affinity chromatography on ouabain-amine-Sepharose columns. The structural homogeneity of two of these antidigoxin antibodies was confirmed by amino acid sequence analysis of purified light chains through the first hypervariable region. These data suggest that the conjugation of small molecules to bacterial polysaccharide vaccines may provide a general method for synthesis of immunogens that can regularly elicit antihapten antibodies of restricted heterogeneity.

Lymphocytes preincubated with various activities of Na251CrO4 were tested for their ability to induce a local, popliteal lymph node graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction. Incubation with 100 micronCi of the isotope per ml of cell suspension impaired the GVH activity, 25 micronCi gave a reduced response in 1 out of 3 experiments, whereas 10 micronCi had no effect. The reduced GVH response was due to radiation rather than chemical damage of the cells. Preincubation of the cells with either cold Na2CrO4 or outdated Na251CrO4 with concentrations of Cr identical to the ones used to label cells with 100 micronCi/ml cells did not impair the GVH reactivity. The cellular uptake of Na251CrO4 showed first-order kinetics over wide concentration ranges. Mitomycin C-treated lymphocytes showed a more heavily depressed GVH reactivity than would be expected from their moderately reduced ability to accumulate in the lymph nodes. It is recommended that doses of Na251CrO4 in excess of 10 micronCi/ml cells should not be used for functional studies of lymphocytes.

Anti-BPO antibodies were purified by means of affinity chromatography using AH-Sepharose 4B coated with covalently bound BPO groups. Specific elution was achieved by the hapten analogue BPO-epsilon-aminocaproic acid (BPO-EACA); desorption of the remaining antibody was performed thereafter by 0.1 M acetic acid. The resulting antibody fractions--hapten-eluted antibody (H-Ab) and acid eluted antibody (A-Ab), respectively--were further separated by ion-exchange chromatography which led to the appearance of 3 subfractions in the case of H-Ab (H1, H2, H3) and 2 subfractions in the case of A-Ab (A1 and A2). In liquid isoelectrofocusing an inhomogeneous pattern resulted. The bulk of antibodies focused between pH 6.5 and 7.0. The average avidity of H-Ab was found to be higher than that of A-Ab suggesting that avidity may influence the elution pattern in affinity chromatography. The hydrophobic influence of the "spacer" and/or interactions of antibodies directed against the hydrophobic regions of the BPO group may explain why a considerable part of the antibodies could be recovered from the immunosorbent only by acid elution.

In the indirect assay for leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (LIF), lymphokine-rich supernatants were obtained by culture of stimulated lymphocytes and then tested for LIF activity in agarose plates using purified granulocytes as target cells. Studies on the standardization of the conditions under which LIF acts on the target cells are described, with emphasis on the use of "standard" supernatants of known LIF activity and the influence of pH on the action of LIF and the sensitivity of the assay. The observation that LIF activity is reduced when the ambient pH falls below 7.2 is suggested as an explanation firstly for the "escape" phenomenon seen particularly in capillary tube assays for LIF, and secondly for the reduced sensitivity of the capillarly tube assay in comparison with the corresponding agarose plate assay.

Renin-containing granules isolated by isopycnic zonal centrifugation were partially characterized biochemically. Extracts of the granules were found to have a dual pH optimum at 5.5-6.0 and 7.0-7.5 and possess linear time-dependence of product formation when reacted with homologous renin substrate. Extracts also possessed a first order reaction constant of 0.713 X 10(-2). Treatment of the extracts with ammonium sulfate increased the velocity of the renin/renin substrate reaction though it continued to be linear with respect to time. This partially purified renin preparation was found to have a Km=3.9 X 10(3) ng/ml. Gel filtration of this preparation of renin demonstrated the presence of an active protein with renin activity and a molecular weight of 59,000 daltons in addition to an inactive protein of molecular weight 13, 750 daltons which may be a potential inhibitor of the renin/renin substrate reaction. The former protein or "big renin" may be the storage form or porhormone state of renin within the renin-containing granules of the juxtaglomerular cells.

Thymus humoral factor (THF), a thymus hormone which participates in the processes leading to acquisition of immunocompetence of lymphoid cells has been isolated in our laboratory by a stepwise gel filtration through various Sephadex columns. THF so isolated appears to be a polypeptide of 3,000 mol wt which contains approximately 30 amino acid residues. Here we have tested the biological activity of THF fractions of successive degrees of purity upon lymphoid cells from both intact and neonatally thymectomized mice. The lymphoid cell populations were treated with the various THF fractions by in vitro incubation for a short time and by repeated injection in vivo. The treated cells evidenced increased ability to react in the graft-versus-host assay in vivo and in mixed lymphocyte cultures in vitro concomitantly with the rise of intracellular cAMP. On the other hand no activity whatsoever was shown by any of the control materials tested. These bioassays permitted isolation of fractions progressively more active than the original crude dialyzate of thymus extract tested. Thus the active peptide component of THF eluted from DEAE Sephadex A-25 column was estimated to be 2 X 10(4)-fold more active than the crude dialyzate of thymus extract which served as a starting material.

A quantitative gas liquid chromatographic method for the determination of serum levels of perazine (10-[3'-(1''-methyl-4''-piperazinyl)-propyl]-phenothiazine) is described. Perazine is used as a neuroleptic drug. The main problem consists in optimizing the chromatographic system. A sensitivity of appr. 60--150 nmol/1 (20--50 microgram/1) serum is achieved. Examples of optimization, analyses with patient samples, and the reproducibility of the results are presented.

In two children exhibiting the clinical symptoms of fucosidosis, the diagnosis was biochemically ascertained by the demonstration of a profound altpha-L-fucosidase deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts. The non-dialysed urines of these fucosidosis patients were separated into two fractions by chromatography on Biogel P-2. The first fraction containing the glycosaminoglycans was further fractionated on Dowex 1 X 2 by stepwise elution with increasing NaCl concentrations. Keratan sulfate-chondroitin sulfates attached to the same peptide core were assayed and characterised mainly in the fractions eluted with 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mol/1 NaCl. Whereas the excretion of normal children of the same age was found to be 0.77 mumol glucosamine equivalents per day in the 2 mol/1 and 3 mol/1 NaCl fraction, the two patients excreted 6.7 (M. C.) and 3.5 (M. S.) mumol glucosamine equivalents per day, respectively. Since keratan sulfate contains alpha-fucose at the non-reducing terminal, this increase in excretion of long chain keratan sulfate in fucosidosis could result from impaired degradation of keratan sulfate, due to the alpha-fucosidase deficiency.

The work by Schachter and his colleagues on the psychological and pharmacological determinants of smoking is reviewed. The experiemental procedures are critically examined, and some are judged to be in violation of ethical standards for the conduct of research with human participants. Questions are raised concerning matters of informed consent, the description of debriefing procedures, and use of the college classroom as a psychological laboratory.

1. The activity of glutamate dehydrogenase was measured in the tissues of the squid, Loligo pealeii. The enzyme occurs in high activity in digestive pouch, systemic heart, and all muscle tissues. 2. Glutamate dehydrogenase from mantle muscle is located intra-mitochondrially, has a molecular weight of 310,000, and is electrophoretically similar to the enzyme from all other squid tissues. 3. The enzyme from mantle muscle  was purified 40-fold by elution from DEAE-cellulose and used for kinetic studies. The enzyme is NAD+-specific, activated by ADP, AMP, and leucine, and inhibited by GTP, GDP, ATP, and reaction products (in particular NADH). 4. Squid glutamate dehydrogenase shows an almost absolute dependence on ADP. The purified enzyme is activated over 100-fold by saturating concentrations of ADP (Ka = 0,75 7M); The pH optima are also altered significantly by ADP. 5. The enzyme appears to be kinetically adapted to favour glutamate oxidation in comparison to glutamate dehydrogenase from other resources. The evidence indicates that the primary role of glutamate dehydrogenase in squid mantle muscle is in regulating the catabolism of amino acids for energy production.

We have investigated, with osmotic techniques, the light-regulated Na+ channels in rod outer segments (ROS) and ROS fragments freshly isolated from the frog retina. Values of Na+ permeability (PNa) similar to those observed electrophysiologically in the retina were observed using the osmotic technique (continuous flow) described by Korenbrot and Cone. In the other osmotic techniques that we explored, PNa was greatly diminished, if not completely suppressed; however, we found with these techniques that antioxidant conditions (N2 atmosphere or EDTA) significantly increased PNa, suggesting that the Na+ channels are highly sensitivive to membrane oxidation. Using the continuous flow technique, we investigated the H+ and Ca++ dependence of the Na+ channels and found that both of these ions, at micromolar activities, can block the channels. Raising the external H+ activity decreases PNa (reversibly) in a single "sigmoidal" response with an apparent pKa of 5.8. Similarly, in the presence of the ionophores X537A or A23187 which allow equilibration of Ca++ across membranes, the Na+ channels are blocked when the external Ca++ activity is increased from 10(-7) to 10(-5) M. This high sensitivity to both H+ and Ca++ ions suggests that high field strength anionic sites may exist in or near the Na+ channels and that the channels are blocked when these sites bind H+ or Ca++ ions.

A higher activity of glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) was found in Neurospora crassa when NH4+ was limiting as nitrogen source than when glutamate was limiting. When glutamate, glutamine or NH4+ were in excess, a lower activity was found. Immunological titration and sucrose gradient sedimentation of the enzyme established that under all these conditions enzyme activity corresponded to enzyme concentration and that the octamer was the predominant oligomeric form. When N. crassa was shifted from nitrogen-limiting substrates to excess product as nitrogen source, the concentration of glutamine synthetase was adjusted with kinetics that closely followed dilution by growth. When grown on limiting amounts of glutamate, a lower oligomer was present in addition to the octameric form of the enzyme. When the culture was shifted to excess NH4+, glutamine accululated at a high rate; nevertheless, there was only a slow decrease in enzyme activity and no modification of the oligomeric pattern.

Heavy density HAV was also shown to be sensitive to low concentrations of RNase. The results of these biophysical and biochemical studies strongly support the notion HAV is an enterovirus.

Daily behavioral observations were made for several years on 10 male schizophrenic patients and on three male patients with organic brain disorders. Analysis of these data showed strong cyclic components in the five schizophrenic patients with predominantly hebephrenic symptomatology. Period lengths noted were about 2 days, 5 to 6 days, 30 days, and a longer cycle of 40 to 100 days duration. Antipsychotic medications appear to have a suppressant effect, but tricyclic antidepressants may enhance pre-existing rhythms.

Adult metachromatic leukodystrophy is a demyelinating disease due to an inherited lack of arylsulfatase A activity. The purpose of this paper is to present the characteristics of this disorder as they occurred chronologically in two siblings, prior to and subsequent to the appearance of gross neurological deficits. A deficit in spatial relationships, as contrasted with verbal abilities, was observed initially in both cases at age 13. Initial psychiatric symptoms were noted at age 16 and 18, with both patients being diagnosed subsequently as schizophrenic. Gross neurological deficits were observed 2 and 13 years, respectively, after the appearance of psychiatric symptoms. A deficit in spatial relationships may be a very sensitive early indicator of adult metachromatic leukodystrophy.

The electrical correlates of activity in the effector systems responsible for swimming, crumpling and postural changes have been recorded in the anthomedusan Polyorchis penicillatus. Motor spikes (pre-swim pulses), that initiate swimming contractions, appear without delay at distant sites on the inner nerve-ring in unstimulated preparations. Levels of Mg++ anaesthesia which block the neuromuscular junctions between PSP giant neurons and swimming muscle do not affect PSP activity. Swimming muscle potentials can be recorded from subumbrella and velar muscle sheets using extra- and intracellular electrodes. These action potentials have a distinct plateau and are propagated in a myoid fashion. Resting potentials average -70 mV with spikes overshooting zero by some 62 mV. The effects of repetitive stimulation are described. Extracellular recordings indicate that neuronal pathways may play a major role in mediating crumpling, unlike many other species where epithelial pathways are more important. Endodermal spikes recorded intracellularly from the radial and ring canals have amplitudes of some 92 mV arising from resting potentials that average -55 mV. Repetitive stimulation causes a decrease in amplitude and increase in duration of epithelial action potentials. Tentacle length is controlled by a pacemaker system located in both nerve rings. The frequency of spikes (PTPs) generated by this system determines the length and tonus of tentacles. The neuromuscular junctions between the motor neurons and tentacle muscle are Mg++ sensitive and show facilitating properties.

The cytochemical localization of adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase was studied in the arteries of the circle of Willis in dogs. The reaction products of both adenylate and guanylate cyclases were similarly distributed and selectively localized predominantly adjacent to sarcoplasmic reticulum and sparsely to mitochondria and outer nuclear membranes of vascular smooth muscles. The observations could suggest a close association of the intracellular localizations of both cyclases and the intracellular calcium storage sites, and ultimately contribute to our complete understanding of regulation of cerebral blood flow and vasospasm.

Defective copper metabolism was demonstrated in male mice bearing the blotchy (Moblo/y) allele at the mottled locus on the X-chromosome. Copper absorption from the gut was only 64% of that found in normal mice and hepatic copper levels were only 56% of the controls. Ceruloplasmin and heart cytochrome c oxidase activities were normal, yet lysyl oxidase activity from cultured fibroblasts was only 45% of control levels. Copper accumulated in fibroblasts cultured from these mutants to values that were five times normal. The accumulation of copper in the fibroblasts was associated with a protein of approximately 12,000 molecular weight.

Tyrosine aminotransferase, in the presence of 8 mM L-cysteine, is inactivated in incubated liver homogenates prepared from normal rats, but not in those from rats deprived of vitamin B6. In this study we fed rats a diet deficient in vitamin B6 to determine the length of time required for in vitro inactivating activity to be lost from liver homogenates. After 2 weeks, the half-life of tyrosine aminotransferase in liver homogenates from vitamin B6-deficient rats was 5.9 hours, and from control rats, 1.8 hours. After 3 weeks, tyrosine aminotransferase was no longer inactivated in homogenates prepared from livers of deficient rats. The pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) concentration of plasma from rats fed the vitamin B6-deficient diet dropped from 89 ng/ml to 14 ng/ml after 1 week and to 7 ng/ml after 2 weeks. In 5 weeks the PLP concentration of liver from vitamin B6-adequate rats increased from 2.9 microgram/g to 6.6 microgram/g while in deficient rats it dropped to 2 microgram/g. The loss of tyrosine aminotransferase inactivating activity in the livers of vitamin B6-deficient rats occurred at approximately the same time that the concentration of PLP in the livers of rats fed the two diets began to show marked differences.

The properties of thiamine diphosphatase (TDPase) and p-nitrophenylphosphatase (p-NPPase) in rat small intestine were investigated. TDPase activity, like p-NPPase activity, was high in the mucosa and in the proximal region. Both activities were high in the membrane-associated fractions of the duodenal mucosa. Furthermore, TDPase had the same properties as intestinal alkaline phosphatase (al-Pase). These results suggest that thiamine diphosphate (TDP) and p-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) are hydrolyzed by a single enzyme, al-Pase, in the intestine.

A trypsin inhibitor was isolated from beans of Phaseolus vulgaris, cultivar. Kintoki, and the specific activity increased 200 times as high as that of the crude extract. It was homogeneous on several electrophoreses and the molecular weight was about 13,000. The amino acid composition was characterized by high ratios of cystine, aspartic acid, and serine. It inhibited trypsin in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 and alpha-chymotrypsin in a molar ratio of 2 : 1. It, however, inhibited neither pepsin nor pronase. It was relatively stable to heat treatment in the acidic medium, but not in the alkaline medium. Neither pepsin nor pronase destroyed the inhibitory function.

The effects of various sugars and sugar derivatives on flavinogenesis were examined using non-growing cells of a high flavinogenic mold, Ashbya gossypii. Glucose, fructose and galactose were found to be the most stimulative. Glycerol and glucono-delta-lactone were less stimulative; next in order were n-propanol, n-butanol, glycols and butanediols, which were likewise effective; acetate, lactate and pyruvate were slightly stimulative. In contrast, ribose, xylose, arabinose, ribitol, citrate, succinate, oxaloacetate, glyoxylate and malate were rather inhibitory, in additions at 1.0%. Among these compounds, ethanol (1%) greatly stimulated  riboflavin formation. Maximum flavinogenesis with the above stimulants was attained by the additions of 1% ethanol, 1.25--3.0% glucose, 1.25% glycerol, 4.0--6.0% propane and butanediols, 1.0% pyruvate and 0.9% acetate after 37 hr incubation, respectively. These compounds inhibited flavinogenesis with increasing concentrations above their optimum concentrations. The stimulation effect of ethanol far exceeded those of other stimulants but ethanol had almost no effect on growth and pH values during incubation. With the addition of ethanol (1%) during incubation, maximum formation (1,776 microgram/g wet mycelia) of riboflavin was achieved when added at the start of incubation and the most effective utilization was observed when added at the logarithmic phase of flavinogenesis, although the maximum formation of riboflavin in the latter case was much lower than in the former case. The relation of sugar metabolism, especially ethanol metabolism, to flavinogenesis was discussed with the flavinogenic activities of these additives.

Using three brands of multiple-scored levodopa tablets, B.P. (500 mg) and one brand of sulphamethoxypyridazine tablets B.P. (500 mg) the weight and content uniformity of the subdivisions has been examined. It is shown that quartering of such tablets can result in subunits which do not conform to recognized standards of weight uniformity, and in some instances content uniformity may be questionable. The homogeneity of distribution of active constituent between tablets has been determined and compared with that within tablets (between quarters of individual tablets). Statistical evaluation of the results is presented.

Plasma concentrations of diftalone have been examined in normal volunteers after a single dose (500 mg) and after 500 mg doses given twice daily for one week. An increase in post dosing urinary excretion of D-glucaric acid showed a correlation with the ratio of calculated to observed areas under the plasma concentration, time curve following the final dose in the multiple dosing studies, indicating that hepatic microsomal enzymes are induced after repeated administration of the drug. Single dose studies in the presence of aluminium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate showed that the antacids had no significant effect on the absorption of diftalone.

A method is described for the assay of phenothiazine sulphoxides which may be formed in phenothiazine formulations during storage under unfavourable conditions. The assay is based upon the measurement of difference absorbance of the sulphoxide solution in 0.2 M hydrochloric acid relative to an equimolar solution reduced with zinc dust. A solvent extraction procedure avoids interference from colouring agents and coloured photolytic breakdown products of the phenothiazines. The assay is specific in the presence of intact drug, sulphone and co-formulated drugs for the formulations examined and is sensitive to 0.5% of the total phenothiazine present as sulphoxide. Many aqueous formulations stored in partially filled containers have been shown to contain up to 31.5% of the total phenothiazine as sulphoxide.

Marked differences were observed, in the ability of fortified 9000 g liver homogenate supernatants from three species to reduce 1-phenyl-2-propanone to the corresponding alcohol. This metabolic keto-reduction was negligible in homogenates from the rat and extensive in the rabbit; guinea-pig liver homogenates had intermediate ability. Metabolic oxidation of 1-phenyl-2-propanol was negligible in all three species. The amount of deamination of amphetamine and of N-n-propylamphetamine was approximately equal, in vitro, in rats and guinea-pigs but two to three times greater in liver homogenates from rabbits. Approximately three times more deaminated products were formed from the in vitro metabolism of N-n-propylamphetamine than from amphetamine metabolism by all three species.

The effects of pyridostigmine pretreatment on the neuromuscular blockade produced by soman in anaesthetized, atropinized animals have been studied on the soleus and anterior tibialis muscle (rhesus monkeys, cats and rabbits) and the gastrocnemius muscle (guinea-pigs and rats). Pyridostigmine pretreatment produced a complete recovery of neuromuscular function following blockade by soman; the rate of recovery was similar in all the species, suggesting a common mechanism of action. In the absence of pyridostigmine or if pyridostigmine was delayed until after blockade by soman, there was no recovery of neuromuscular function. Detailed studies in the guinea-pig showed that the recovery of neuromuscular function was related to the dose of soman and to the degree of carbamoylation of blood cholinesterase at the time of nerve agent challenge, i.e. to the dose of pyridostigmine and the time interval between the administration of pyridostigmine and soman. It is suggested that the effectiveness of pyridostigmine pretreatment is due to the carbamoylation of a portion of the tissue acetylcholinesterase, which protects it against irreversible inhibition by soman: after poisoning spontaneous decarbamoylation produces sufficient free acetylcholinesterase to restore normal function.

The effect of physostigmine has been studied on cholinesterase in homogenates of chick biventer cervicis muscles and on the contractile responses of the intact muscles to acetylcholine and carbachol. The concentration of physostigmine required to produce the maximum increase in sensitivity to acetylcholine almost completely inhibited the cholinesterase in muscle homogenates. This concentration of physostigmine had no effect on muscle contractures elicited by carbachol. By taking account of the combined effects of acetylcholine diffusion and enzymic hydrolysis, a quantitative theoretical relationship has been derived between the level of cholinesterase activity in cylindrical muscles and the fractional occupancy of the acetylcholine receptors in these muscles in the presence of different concentrations of exogenous acetylcholine. This theory attributes the thousand-fold increase in sensitivity to exogenous acetylcholine produced by anticholinesterases in chick biventer cervicis muscles largely to an alteration in acetylcholine concentration gradient within the muscle and accounts satisfactorily for the shift in the dose-response curve for acetylcholine which occurs after treatment of the muscles with various concentrations of physostigmine.

Isolated chicken bronchus contracts to carbachol, PGF2alpha, histamine, 5-HT, bradykinin and phenylephrine. The bronchial strips from the horse plasma sensitized domestic fowl contracted to specific sensitizing antigen in vitro (Schultz-Dale anaphylactic reaction) and were 5 to 10 fold more reactive to PGF2alpha, histamine and 5-HT compared with the bronchi from normal chickens. Second antigen challenge was inactive or produced a weak response (desensitization). Allowing the bronchi to rest for 1 h resulted in partial recovery of anaphylactic response. Bronchi which had partially contracted submaximally to carbachol, antigen or PGF2alpha, relaxed to isoprenaline, adrenaline and PGE1 and E2.

A method is reported which allows continuous long-term drug administration and simultaneous blood pressure measurement in the unanaesthetized unrestrained rat. The external jugular vein and abdominal aorta were cannulated and the opposite ends of the cannulae were passed subcutaneously and exteriorized at the back of the head. They were then passed through a spring attached at the lower end to the skull and, at the upper end, to a counter-weighted cantilever. In rats so prepared, infusion of angiotensin amide 200 ng kg-1 min-1 caused a rise of blood pressure which lasted the 48 h infusion period. Heart rate decreased initially but recovered within 6 h. Angiotensin amde 30 ng kg-1 min-1, infused up to seven days, was without effect on blood pressure or heart rate, and both doses of angiotensin amide failed to alter cardiac catecholamine turnover. Hydralazine, mecamylamine and clonidine reduced blood pressure to 63, 62 and 84% of control respectively while clonidine induced a transient increase before its depressor effect. Heart rate was increased by hydralazine to 138%, and decrease by clonidine to 74% of control, and was unaffected by mecamylamine. The magnitude of pressor response to noradrenaline, tyramine and angiotensin was reduced by hydralazine and increased by mecamylamine. Clonidine increased the pressor response to angiotensin but had no effect on that to noradrenaline or tyramine.

The degradation rate, solubility, and dissolution rate of amino penicillins, amoxicillin, ampicillin, epicillin, and cyclacillin, were determined quantitatively as a function of pH. In the pH range studied, 0.30-10.50, the degradation of amoxicillin and epicillin followed pseudo-first-order kinetics to give the same type of pH-rate profiles as those of ampicillin and cyclacillin. Cyclacillin anhydrate was the most soluble, followed in order by ampicillin anhydrate, ampicillin trihydrate, amoxicillin trihydrate, and epicillin anhydrate. These pH-solubility profiles showed showed U-shaped curves. The dissolution rate constants from the rotating disk were analyzed by the simultaneous chemical reaction and diffusion models. Their relative bioavailability after a single oral administration was assessed from their physicochemical properties determined in vitro.

IR and X-ray analyses of the interaction of clindamycin with montmorillonite indicate that clindamycin is adsorbed by a cation-exchange mechanism under pH conditions favoring the cationic form of the drug and by physical adsorption when the unionized drug is present. This physical adsorption is relatively weak since the drug is readily desorbed by alkaline washing. Tetracycline is adsorbed by cation exchange at low pH values where the +00 species predominates. Complexation with divalent interlayer cations contributes significantly to adsorption at higher pH values where the +-0 and +-- species exist. In a strongly alkaline solution, the 0-- species was not adsorbed in the interlayer space of montmorillonite but rather produced an external calcium-tetracycline complex. This study illustrates the utility of X-ray and IR analyses in elucidating the mechanisms responsible for clay-drug interactions.

The kinetics of the thermal degradation of promethazine in an acidic medium under various conditions were investigated. The degradation of promethazine and the formation of some degradation products were studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The influence of pH, metal ions such as copper(II) and iron (III), and antioxidants was investigated. In an oxygen-saturated medium, promethazine generally followed first-order kinetics. Increasing the pH increased the degradation rate to a limiting value at pH 5. Addition copper (II) increased the degradation rate over the whole process, while iron (III) caused an increase for only a short time. Ascorbic acid sometimes increased the degradation rate, while higher concentrations of hydroquinone also accelerated the degradation. Pyrosulfite did not have any influence. Under anaerobic conditions, promethazine degraded only in the presence of copper (II) and iorn (III) ions. As a result of the studies on the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the oxidation process, a mechanism for the oxidative degradation of promethazine is suggested. Promethazine 5-oxide and a number of degradation products without intact side chains are formed via a semiquinone free radical. The influence of several factors on the degradation process is discussed.

The titration of sodium carbonate with aluminum nitrate is shown to produce amorphous aluminum hydroxycarbonate. This compound is not stoichiometric, although the maximum carbonate to aluminum ratio appears to be 0.5. The pH conditions for achieving the maximum carbonate content are concentration dependent. A model for the particle surface at the solution interface is proposed. This model accounts for the presence of carbonate directly coordinated to the aluminum and carbonate adsorbed by electrostatic forces. Sodium is present in the diffuse layer and is, therefore, not an integral part of the structure.

The present study showed that published spectrophotometric and GLC methods for hydralazine in plasma do not distinguish between the drug and a major plasma metabolite, hydralazine pyruvic acid hydrazone. These methods involve the acid treatment of the sample, which hydrolyzes that hydrazone back to hydralazine. A specific GLC assay for the hydrazone was developed and involves its selective extraction from plasma and transformation to 3-trifluoromethyl-s-triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazine. This derivative could be sensitively measured by GLC using an electron-capture detector. With this procedure, it was shown that most "apparent hydralazine" in plasma is the hydrazone, which forms rapidly from hydralazine and endogenous pyruvic acid. Previous work indicated that the hydrazone was inactive when administered intravenously to rabbits.

An automated potentiometric procedure was used for studying in vitro dissolution kinetics of acidic drugs. Theoretical considerations indicated that the pH-stat method could be used to establish approximate sink conditions or, possibly, a perfect sink. Data obtained from dissolution studies using the pH-stat method were compared with data obtained from known sink and nonsink conditions. These comparisons indicated that the pH-stat method can be used to establish a sink condition for dissolution studies. The effective diffusion layer thicknesses for benzoic and salicylic acids dissolving in water were determined, and a theoretical dissolution rate was calculated utilizing these values. The close agreement between the experimental dissolution rates obtained under pH-stat conditions and theoretical dissolution rates indicated that perfect sink conditions were established under the experimental conditions used.

Women undergoing abortion by intraamniotic prostaglandin F2alpha were randomized to receive either prochlorperazine edisylate 10mg, hydroxyzine hydrochloride 100mg, or a placebo every four hours by intramuscular injection in a double-blind fashion. Vomiting was significantly more frequent in the placebo-treated group [0.2 +/- 1.5 SD episodes per patient, n=21]  than in the groups treated with prochlorperazine [1.2 +/- 0.5 episodes per patient, n=21] or hydroxyzine [0.3 +/- 0.8 episodes per patient, n=19]. The mean number of merperidine injections in the antiemetic-treated groups was lower than in the control group, but this effect was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference between the treated and the control groups in the interval from prostaglandin treatment to abortion.

Several new alpha-amino-alpha-phenyl-o-tolytriazoles and -imidazoles have been prepared in one step by means of a novel reductive rearrangement of the corresponding benzodiazepines with hydrazine hydrate. These new triazoles were found to have moderate sedative and muscle relaxing activity in mice (i.e., these compounds depressed the traction and dish reflexes at higher doses than did diazepam) but were very potent antagonists of the clonic convulsions induced in mice by the administration of pentylenetetrazole. Furthermore, they antagonized the lethality induced by thiosemicarbazide. While these new compounds were very active in mice, most were inactive in rats. These results are discussed with reference to the metabolism of compound 13.

The synthesis of N-hydroxyacetaminophen (N-acetyl-N-hydroxy-p-aminophenol, 4), a postulated toxic metabolite of acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol, 3), and its phenolic sulfate conjugate (potassium N-acetyl-N-hydroxy-p-aminophenyl sulfate) (13) is described. Potassium p-nitrophenyl sulfate was reduced to the hydroxylamine, acetylated, and treated with sulfatase to yield N-hydroxyacetaminophen. The structures assigned are supported by the spectral data (IR, UV, MS, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR). N-Hydroxyacetaminophen was found to be moderately unstable at physiological pH and temperature, whereas it phenolic sulfate conjugate was stable.

The synthesis and some pharmacological effects of 16 3-aryl analogues of butaclamol, a new antipsychotic drug, are described. The animal models were predictive of neuroleptic activity as well as side effects commonly associated with neuroleptic therapy. The results indicate that the 3-substituent plays a critical role with regard to the potency of the compounds as well as to their tendencies to induce extrapyramidal side effects and/or hypotension.

trans-Aziridine-2,3-dicarboxylic ester was used to prepare the required beta-chlorohydroxamic acid used in the synthesis of the title compound. The trans configuration of the asparagine analogue was established by hydrogenolysis to erythro-beta-hydroxyasparagine amide. Neither the title compound nor the intermediate aziridinehydroxamic acid (8) showed significant activity against the L1210 and P-388 tumors. The title compound was inactive as an inhibitor of asparagine synthetase from Novikoff hepatoma and did not inhibit the growth of some 25 bacteria and fungi.

Postaxial polydactyly type A was present in several members of a Sicilian family. The anomaly was probably transmitted as an autosomal recessive character. Two polydactylous subjects were also beta-thalassaemia carriers, but a linkage between the two mutant genes could be excluded. Two patients with hexadactyly had a fifth digital triradius.

Polymerization of alanine adenylate in the presence of various clays in their Na form gave increasing degrees of polymerization in the following order: montmorillonite less than nontronite less than hectorite. With montmorillonite, presaturated with different cations the order was: Mg less Ca less than Fe less than Al less than Na. From all these clays, hectorite was the only one to enable also some polymerization of lysine.

In the previous article we try to give an explanation for the success of models of enzymatic reactions in which coenzymes play a role. However, one vital cofactor that has thus far not yielded appreciably to this approach is biotin. We attempt to show that biotin presents a fundamentally new sort of problem to bioorganic chemistry; this problem requires consideration both of the origin of life and subsequent evolution in any attempt to understand the anomalies offered by this cofactor.

Calf brain prolidase covalently bound to CNBr-Sepharose 4B, retained about 32% of the activity of the uncoupled enzyme. The free enzyme showed slightly greater stability than the bound preparation when stored at 20 degrees C or at 0 degrees C. However, in either case the free and bound enzymes were more stable at the lower temperature. Greater thermal stability was shown by the free enzyme than by the bound preparation over a temperature range of 25 degrees C-60 degrees C. The free and bound prolidase, with and without Mn+2, had maximal activity at pH 4.0. Although the bound enzyme showed a single maximum, the free preparation exhibited three pH maxima of 4.0, 9.0, and 6.5, in decreasing order of activity. The ions Ag+, Cu+, Hg+2, and Zn+2 were strongly inhibitory on the free enzyme, whereas inhibition of the bound enzyme, with the exception of Zn+2 , was less. Unlike the coupled enzyme, a stimulatory effect was obtained on the free preparation with Co+3, Mg+2, and Mn+2. Various other compounds were studied and their effects were noted.

An alkaline protease was found to be associated with the granulosis virus of the Indian meal moth. Plodia interpunctella. The protease was located within the protein matrix of the occluded virus and hydrolyzed the major constituent of this matrix, a 28,000-dalton protein (granulin), to a mixture of polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 10,000 to 27,000. A rapid, sensitive assay for the protease was developed using radioactively labeled granulosis virus as substrate. With this assay, the proteolytic activity could be detected by measuring the release of acid-soluble peptides from the labeled virus. The protease had a pH optimum of 10.5 and a temperature optimum of 40 degrees C and was inhibited by diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and L-(1-tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone. Purification of the protease from matrix protein was achieved by anion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography. The molecular weight of the isolated protease, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, was approximately 14,000.

The mosaic karyotype XO/XY is expressed by a spectrum of genital phenotypes, ranging from normal male through ambiguous genitalia to normal female. The urologist may see some of these patients because of the following clinical presentations: 1) ambiguous genitalia with a chromatin-negative buccal smear, 2) hypospadias with cryptorchidism or 3) cryptorchidism with müllerian remnants, discovered unexpectedly during inguinal operations. Reliable karyotyping is mandatory for diagnosis of XO/XY patients. Management should include laparotomy with excision of any intra-abdominal gonads (testis and/or streak gonad) because these are prone to develop malignancies that may occur before puberty. Female sex assignment and a reconstructive operation are advised in cases with severely deficient virilization of the genitalia.

The first case of bilateral trifid ureters associated with fused kidney, ureterovesical stenosis, a left undescended testicle and angioma of the bladder is reported. Bilateral ureteroneocystostomy and left orchiopexy were done. The patient is well 3 months postoperatively with no urinary tract infection and stable renal function.

The determination of small amount of chlorine in the atmosphere is carried on ordinarily by omicron-toluidine method at present. However, this method is not recommended because the issued colour is unstable and omicron-toluidine itself belongs in the first group member of the Ordinance on Prevention of Particular Chemical Hazards Substances. Authors recommend 4-nitroaniline method, reported by J. Gabbay etc., because this method is stable and more practical. Although the colour that issued from the reaction of chlorine with 4-nitroaniline is affected by the co-existence of reducing gas, e.g. SO2, H2S or organic gas, but this effect may be removed the co-existence of reducing gas, e.g. SO2, H2S or organic gas, but this effect may be removed by introducing the sample gas into the layer of H2SO4-52Cr2O7 mixture immersed in glassfiber filter for micro-analysis. In this paper, influence of pH of the issued colour, stability, stream velocity of samplegas and effect of reducing substance are discussed.

The effect of beta-adrenergic blocking agents inderal, trazicor, visken, benzoral and aptin on the bronchial patency was studied by means of four ventilation indices in 85 patients, 62 of whome had various diseases of the lungs; 44 of these patients had bronchial obstruction. It was established that all beta-blocking agents are detrimental to bronchial patency in patients with concomitant bronchial obstruction. In exacerbation of bronchial asthma, beta-blocking agents are contraindictaed. When it is necessary to prescribe beta-blocking agents for other patients with concomitant bronchial obstruction visken is the drug of choice. It should be given per os, with preliminary control of the function of external respiration.

A 36-year-old man suffered from diarrhoea for some weeks and was treated with Salazosulphapyridie and Fluocortulon when he developed a transient myopia combined with an angle closure glaucoma. The refraction of his mild hyperopic eyes (+0,5 dpt) changed to -5,5 dpt and the intraocular pressure increased to 40 mm Hg in the right and 42 mm Hg in the left eye. Accommodation and pupillary reflexes were normal. Ultrasonic examination showed an increased axial diameter and a forward shifting of the lens. The resulting flattening of the anterior chamber induced the angle closure glaucoma. All symptoms disappeared within a week after the administration of Fluocortulon had been discontinued.

Pyrrolizidine alkaloids occur in more than 40 genera. Among these are two important genera, Senecio and Crotalaria, which have been responsible for heavy losses of livestock and poisoning in man due to their hepatotoxicity. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are also reported to possess a number of other biological activities. Attempts have been made to convert the pyrrolizidine alkaloids to new structures by synthetic modifications. One hundred and twenty semisynthetic compounds were developed and investigated pharmacologically. The range of activity exhibited was hypotensive, local anesthetic, ganglion blocking, neuromuscular blocking and antispasmodic. The five most promising compounds of these series were subjected to detailed pharmacological investigations.

Oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves (ODC) were performed on blood from newly diagnosed, nonketotic diabetics prior to and following initial insulin treatment and from ambulatory juvenile diabetics before and after their usual morning insulin. In 10 newly discovered diabetics the average P50 at in vivo pH was normal prior to insulin (26.2 mm Hg), decreased to 24.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) on the day following the initial insulin administration, and was within normal limits (26.9 mm Hg) when the diabetes was finally well controlled and red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) had risen to elevated levels. Oxygen affinity of hemoglobin was closely correlated with the content of red cell 2,3-DPG (r = 0.61, p less than 0.001) but was unrelated to the level of hemoglobin Alc. In 40 juvenile patients the average P50 was also normal prior to insulin administration but was significantly lower 3-4 hr after they had received their usual insulin dose (p less than 0.001). The study indicates that insulin administration to diabetics with high blood glucose levels may lead to transient decreases in red cell 2,3-DPG and in oxygen-releasing capacity of the red blood cells.

The kinetic properties of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) extracted from the mycelia of Neurospora crassa were examined at physiological pH to determine the role of the enzyme in the regulation of glycolysis. The velocity curve with the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adenosine diphosphate, are hyperbolic. The effect of magnesium, potassium, or calcium on the enzyme is influenced by the pH but not to the extent that would change their role as cofactor or inhibitor. Adenosine triphosphate and citrate remain strong inhibitors even with changes in pH. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate and glucose-6-phosphate are the dual positive effectors at physiological pH. Valine is the only amino acid that inhibits the enzyme at a concentration range of valine found in the mycelial juice. Thus, the properties of the enzyme at physiological pH are significantly different from those observed at neutral pH of the usual assay conditions, but its role as a key regulator of glycolysis is unchanged.

The influence of pH on the specific growth rates of two acidophilic and two neutrophilic soil streptomycetes was studied. The acidophiles had maximum growth rates over a broad range from pH 4.5 to 5.5, while the neutrophiles had clearly defined optima at pH 7.0. Mycelium of neutrophiles was less tolerant of acidity than that of acidophiles; both showed decreased viability at pH levels below those which allowed growth. Spores of neutrophiles and acidophiles were equally tolerant of acidity and this may allow the former to survive in acid soils. Both spores and mycelium of acidophiles remained viable at pH levels above those allowing growth.

Log phase cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus (luteus) IFO 3333 autolyzed when incubated at 37 C in 0.01 M sodium-phosphate buffer pH 7.5. The enzyme involved in the autolysis was recovered mainly in an aqueous phase from cytoplasmic membranes and cytoplasmic materials treated with n-butanol, and proved to be an N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase. The autolysis of log phase cells suspended in autolyzing buffer was depressed by the addition of trypsin to the buffer.

A method for quantitative extraction of extravasated dye from the skin was studied in guinea pigs and rats. A simple method with a low cost and good recovery was established as follows; A piece of the skin containing extravasated dye was soaked overnight in a stoppered glass tube containing 1 ml of 1 N KOH at 37 C. Then, 9 ml of mixed solution of 0.6 N H3PO4 and acetone (5:13) was added to the tube. The tube was shaken vigorously for a few seconds and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min. Absorbance of supernatant was measured at 620 nm. The recovery rate of the dye was about 95 per cent both in guinea pigs and rats. Using this method we observed that fasting stress significantly reduced the intensity of skin reaction induced by chemical mediators, heterologous PCA and especially homologous PCA in guinea pigs.

The increase of serum gamma-GT after hormonal stimulation has been reported as a new provocative test in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. The test was suggested to be more sensitive than the serum amylase provocation test. In a clinical study of both tests in 83 consecutive patients the unsensitivity and the high rate of false positive results were demonstrated. Thus these provocation tests do not seem to be valuable in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.

Acetic acid was found to repress cholinesterase synthesis in the cells of Arthrobacter simplex var. cholinesterasus even at very low concentrations (0.1%). The repression is very stable. It is not eliminated by glucose or an organic acid of the Krebs cycle being added to the medium with acetic acid. The combination of acetic and butyric acids decreases the repression but does not eliminate it. The kinetics of cholinesterase synthesis was different in the cells grown on the medium with acetic acid and the cells cultivated on the medium with acetic acid and glucose, then washed and transferred to a fresh growth medium with glucose and acetylcholine as the sources of carbon.

A 19-year old male ingested in suicidal attempt 750 mg of thallium. He developed the characteristic symptoms of thallium intoxication. During the acute phase the urinary excretion of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors was largely increased. The percentage distribution of the individual metabolites of heme synthesis revealed a preponderance of kopro- and uroporphyrin. This constellation (kopro- greater than uro- greater than tricarboxylic porphyrin) differs appreciably from that one in lead intoxication. The observation of increased urinary excretion of porphyrins and their precursors in a possibly particular spectrum in thallium intoxication is of special interest for differential-diagnostic reasoning. In each case of a toxic disorder of porphyrin metabolism thallium intoxication ought to be considered a possible cause.

The effect of copper ions and unfavourable pH values of the medium on the incorporation of labelled precursors of protein and RNA was studied in Candida utilis. Specific inhibition of protein synthesis by copper ions and alkaline conditions was found. No specific inhibition of protein or RNA was detected at low pH values of the medium.

The effect of growth inhibiting values of pH of the medium (pH 2.3 and 7.8) on physiological, morphological and cytological characteristics was studied with the chemostat culture of Candida utilis. Changes in the pH of the medium were accompanied with a decrease in the economic coefficient of the yeast cells, an increase in the respiratory quotient and the activity of phosphohydrolase. Phase-contrast micriscopy has shown that, at acid pH values, the cells were smaller than in the control (in the cells grown under optimal conditions) and rather uniform, oval or rounded, and contained large lipid granules. The presence of large lipid granules was confirmed by electron microscopy; vacuoles were smaller than in the control cells, but their number was greater than one; mitochondria stuck together and had one general outer membrane; the cell wall was 3--4 times thicker. At alkaline pH values of the medium, the whole cellular organization of C. utilis was disordered: the cells were larger, the size of vacuoles increased too much, and the structure became heterogeneous.

A rapid anaysis of parameters of the acid-base equilibrium and blood gases during open heart surgery and emergency therapy is absolutely necessary. Computing of the several parameters of the acid-base status by slide rules or nomograms is time consuming and can be shortened by computer applications. The central blood gas laboratory consists of a blood gas analyzer for PO2, PCO2 and pH, an electronic desktop calculator, a four color X-Y-plotter and two data lines to the cardiac surgery unit and to the intensive care unit. The time needed for computing and feedback of the parameters could be decreased to one quarter. In addition to numerical data printout, a graphical representation of the several parameters is possible on a X-Y-plotter and includes the Rahn-Fenn-O2-CO2-Diagram with venous admixture, ventilation perfusion ratio, alveolar dead space ventilation and the standard and actual oxygen dissociation curve as well as the pH/HCO3- Acid-Base nomogram. Furthermore, a computer diagnosis of the actual disturbances can be plotted.

Electrophoresis of ribosomal proteins according to Kaltschmidt and Wittmann, 1970a, b (pH 8.6/pH 4.5 urea system) yielded 29 proteins for the small subunits and 35 and 37 proteins for the large subunits of Krebs II ascites and HeLa ribosomes, respectively. Analysis of the proteins according to a modified technique by Mets and Bogorad (1974) (pH 4.5/pH 8.6 SDS system) revealed 28 and 29 proteins in the small subunits and 37 and 38 proteins in the large subunits of Krebs II ascites and HeLa ribosomes. The molecular weights of the individual proteins were determined by: 1. "three-dimensional" gel electrophoresis; 2. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis at pH 4.K/pH 8.6 in SDS. The molecular weights for 40S proteins ranged from 10,000 to 39,000 dalton (number average molecular weight: 21,000). The molecular weights for the 60S proteins ranged from 14,000 to 44,000 dalton (number average molecular weight: 23,000) using the "three-dimensional" technique. A molecular weight range from 10,000 to 38,000 dalton (number average molecular weight: 21,000) was obtained for the 40S subunits, whereas the molecular weights for the 60S ribosomal proteins (average molecular weight: 26,000) ranged from 12,000 to 69,000 dalton using the pH 4.5/pH 8.6 SDS system. The molecular weights Krebs II ascites and HeLa ribosomal proteins are compared with those obtained by other authors for different mammalian species.

When the pH of growth medium containing a limited amount of inorganic phosphate is kept below 3.0, cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce repressible alkaline phosphatase but no repressible acid phosphatase. The same cells produce acid phosphatase immediately on shifting the medium pH to 4.0 or above. Like intact cells, spheroplasts prepared from cells grown at pH 3.0 or 4.5 in medium with a limited amount of inorganic phosphate in suspension begin production of acid phosphatase immediately after pH shift from below 3.0 to 4.0 whereas sheroplasts from cells grown in inorganic phosphate-rich medium showed a prolonged lag period (3 h). The enzyme formation on the pH shift was sensitive to cycloheximide. No significant differences could be detected in cellular growth or in incorporation of 3H-L-lysine or 14C-adenine between cells cultivated at pH 3.0 and 4.5. These results along with the fact that the expression of structural genes of repressible acid and alkaline phosphatases is controlled by a common genetic regulatory system, at least in part, indicate that the genetic regulatory system operates to express the structural genes even at low pH, though the expression of repressible acid phosphatase is interrupted. Coupled experiments of temperature and pH shifts with the temperature-sensitive mutants of the regulatory genes suggest that the acidic pH affects the function of the cytoplasmic products of those genes in the expression of the structural gene. Based on these observations, a revised model involving the simultaneous functioning of the regulatory factors was suggested for the genetic regulation of repressible acid phosphatase synthesis.

An efficient method for the production of synchronous zygotes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is described. Cells were synchronised under defined conditions in either an a, alpha mixed culture or by incubation of each mating type in cell-free medium in which cells of the opposite mating type had been grown. Synchronised cells were allowed to fuse under defined conditions on filter membranes. This method was used to test the fidelity of conjugation in S. cerevisiae. Under conditions where cells of a or alpha mating type were in contact with up to 6 cells of each of two strains of opposite mating type, less than 1 multiple mating in 10(4) diploid matings occurred. It is concluded that is sexual conjugation in S. cerevisiae some process distinct from cell contact restricts cell fusion to paired combinations of conjugant cells.

Four pyrazolones in frequent use, i.e. antipyrine (AP), aminopyrine (AMP), sulpyrine (SP) and isopropylantipyrine (IPA), were compared for their reactivity with nitrite and for the in vitro mutagenicity of their reaction products by Ames' reversion tests. In various acidic solutions at 37 degrees C, AP, AMP and SP were found to react easily with nitrite and yield various products including dimethylnitrosamine (DMNA) and 4-nitrosoantipyrine (4-NAP) in the cases of AMP and AP, respectively. When tested with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 after lyophilization, the reaction products of AP (AP-N) were found to be mutagenic in both strains, while products of AMP and SP (AMP-N and SP-N) were mutagenic only in TA100. The presence of unknown ultimate mutagens, other than DMNA and 4-NAP, were evidenced in AP-N, AMP-N and SP-N. Incubation with S-9 mixture did not affect the mutagenicity of SP-N and decreased that of AP-N and AMP-N. In clear contrast to AP, AMP and SP, it was found that IPA remained essentially intact upon reaction with nitrite. No mutagenicity was detected with the reaction mixture (IPA-N) in either strain.

1. Substance P (SP) could be extracted from brain homogenates with chloroform-methanol by a method which extracts all lipids. 2. SP could be transferred form this total lipid extract (TLE) into an aqueous solution at low pH values (2.0--3.0). 3. At higher pH values (5.5) SP could be transferred from an aqueous phase into an organic phase (chloroform:methanol, 2:1) and recombined with TLE (which was previously freed from endogenous SP) contained in this phase. The binding capacity of TLE for SP exceeded by far the amount of endogenous SP bound originally in the brain extracts. 4. Among the lipids present in TLE, phosphatidylserine was able to bind and release SP in a pH dependent manner. 5. It is suggested that SP bound to phosphatidylserine is the storage form of SP in the brain. The mechanisms by which it is released are still unknown. The possibility that the SP-receptor is also a phospholipid is considered.

The interaction of cortico- and nigrofugal inputs to the striatum of the rat was investigated using the technique of evoked potentials. Repetitive, unilateral stimulation of the substantia nigra inhibited potentials which were evoked from the ipsilateral rostral cortex and recorded from the ipsilateral striatum. The inhibition was antagonized by low doses of various intraperitoneally administered neuroleptics such as: pimozide (0.1 - 0.2 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.1 - 0.5 mg/kg), chlorpromazine (0.5 - 2.0 mg/kg) and thioridazine (0.5 - 4.0 mg/kg). These findings are discussed in view of the existing controversy regarding the mode of action of dopamine in the striatum.

Following 4 weeks of treatment with ORF-8063 a polyfluorinated benzodiazepine derivative, 8 hospitalized patients manifesting a primary pathology of anxiety showed marked general improvement. 2 other persons were treated, but for shorter periods: 9 and 14 days. Both are included in the pre-post analysis. Mean optimal dosage was 66.5 mg. The five instruments used to measure therapeutic effect showed pre- to posttreatment change with high level of statistical significance in serveral of the pathological factors. When measures of change are considered, patients showed more improvement related to psychic than somatic components of anxiety. Change data also indicates more patients improvement in anxiety than depression. Side effects reported more were dizziness, faintness and insomnia; these were reported in 8 patients. 6 patients noted drowsiness, and 4 noted excitement. 5 persons tolerated optimum dosages with no extreme reactions; 5 others (including the 2 subjects who terminated treatment early) were unable to maintain optimum dosages because of side effects.

To determine the duration of respiratory arrest needed to attain a PaCO2 level high enough to provide maximal stimulation of respiration, we evaluated changes in PaCO2, PaO2 and apH during periods of apnea lasting as long as 10 minutes in 10 apparently brain-dead subjects. Before apnea, mean PaCO2 was 33 mm Hg. In seven subjects who did not breathe for 10 minutes, the mean rate of rise of PaCO2 was 3.2 mm Hg per minute. PaCO2 at 4 minutes was 50 mm Hg and at 10 minutes was 67 mm Hg. Three subjects breathed, two after less than 2 minutes of apnea, when PaCO2 was 47 and 54 mm Hg, and one after 4.5 minutes, when PaCO2 was 47 mm Hg. These data indicate: (1) that the threshold for respiratory stimulation may approach a PaCO2 of 60 mm Hg in patients with brain damage; (2) that the rate of increase in PaCO2 is such that, even in a normocapnic subject after 3 minutes of apnea, the PaCO2 may not be sufficiently high to stimulate respiration; and (3) if a patient is hypocapnic prior to the onset of apnea, PaCO2 may not reach 60 mm Hg even after 15 minutes. To confirm absolute apnea, then, blood gas monitoring is necessary for verification of normocapnia prior to the beginning of apnea. In the absence of blood gas determinations, no fixed period of apnea, sufficient in all cases to establish absolute apnea, can be ascertained.

To explore the role of thiamine deficiency in synaptic transmission, the high-affinity uptake and release systems for putative neurotransmitters were studied in synaptosomal preparations isolated from the telencephalon, hypothalamus, and cerebellum of rats made thiamine deficient by diet or pyrithiamine. There was significant decrease in the uptake of serotonin by the synaptosomal preparations of the cerebellum. Although thiamine and its phosphorylated forms added in vitro did not restore the decreased serotonin uptake, the administration of the vitamin in vivo resulted in a significant reversibility of the inhibition of serotonin uptake, coinciding with dramatic clinical improvement. The study supports the possibility of an important serotonergic innervation of the cerebellum and suggests a selective involvement of this system in the pathogenesis of some of the neurologic manifestations of thiamine deficiency.

The infection of larvae of Culex pipiens molestus, C. vagans and C. tritaeniorhynchus (the vector of the virus of Japanese encephalitis) with the entomopathogenic fungus Coelomomyces iliensis from Kazakhstan was carried out in the Primorje Territory in 1973--1974. At the infection of larvae of C. tritaeniorhynchus with the suspension of infected larvae the mortality was recorded only from 60% of individuals, while at the infection with a content of sporangia--from 36.6% of larvae. Somewhat less mortality (27.5%) was observed among larvae of C. pipiens molestus and C. pipiens. In control the mortali larvae did not exceed 5%.

In cats anesthetized with chloralose-urethane, the central respiratory chemoreceptors were exposed to mock CSF of pH 7.02, 7.02, or 7.57. The right carotid body was simultaneously stimulated by intracarotid injections of 40, 80, or 160 microgram sodium cyanide in 200 microliter Ringer solution. The left carotid nerve and, in some animals, both vagosympathetic truncs were dissected. It could be demonstrated that the increase in ventilation produced by application of NaCN to the peripheral chemoreceptors is significantly larger at high than at low mock CSF pH (i.e. at low than at high central stimulus intensity). In vagotomized cats the responses of VT and V to NaCN similarly depend upon CSF pH; they are somewhat larger, though, than in intact animals. These results are discussed as compared with results reported by different authors.

In the operative verification of vagotomy, electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves with the study of pH should seem to be a reliable method. On the basis of an experiment in the cat, the authors emphasise the effectiveness of electrical stimulation of gastric acid secretion, confirmed by 16 clinical cases. Stimulation of the proximal end of the divided right nerve may be used to detect a nervous strand arising above the level of the section and to confirm the completeness of left vagotomy.

The acid-base titration (pH 8 --> pH 2.5 --> pH 8) of eleven mixing curve samples of the poly(dG) plus poly(dC) system has been performed in 0.15 M NaCl. Upon protonation, poly(dG).poly(dC) gives rise to an acid complex, in various amounts according to the origin of the sample. We have established that the hysteresis of the acid-base titration is due to the non-reversible formation of an acid complex, and the liberation of the homopolymers at the end of the acid titration and during the base titration: the homopolymer mixtures remain stable up to pH 7. A 1G:1C stoichiometry appears to be the most probable for the acid complex, a 1G:2C stoichiometry, as found in poly(C(+)).poly(I).poly(C) or poly(C(+)).poly(G).poly(C), cannot be rejected. In the course of this study, evidence has been found that the structural consequences of protonation could be similar for both double stranded poly(dG).poly(dC) and G-C rich DNA's: 1) protonation starts near pH 6, dissociation of the acid complex of poly(dG).poly(dC) and of protonated DNA take place at pH 3; 2) the CD spectrum computed for the acid polymer complex displays a positive peak at 255 nm as found in the acid spectra of DNA's; 3) double stranded poly(dG).poly(dC) embedded in triple-stranded poly(dG).poly(dG).poly(dC) should be in the A-form and appears to be prevented from the proton induced conformational change. The neutral triple stranded poly(dG).poly(dG).poly(dC) appears therefore responsible, although indirectly, for the complexity and variability of the acid titration of poly(dG).poly(dC) samples.

The large hysteresis observed during the acid-base titration of poly(dG). poly (dC) was studied by CD and potentiometric scanning curves. Intermediate scanning loops as well as the equilibrium and metastable branches of the hysteresis loop have been determined. The potentiometric titrations showed, however, that the various complexes were not discrete entities, but were linked in "polycomplexes" as had been already suggested. This prevented a thermodynamic study of the system. The acid-base titration was further investigated as a function of ionic strength and temperature. The pK's showed considerably lower ionic strength dependence than observed for polyribonucleotide complexes. The thermal transitions permitted to establish the relative stabilities of the various complexes between pH 2.5 and pH 12.0.

Cross-linking experiments with the MONOfunctional imidoester methyl-acetimidate, in the pH range 7.0 - 8.0, on rat liver nucleosomes generate a cross-linking pattern almost identical with the one observed for much longer BIfunctional reagents (e.g. dimethylsuberimidate). Combined cross-linking and trypsin digestion experiments suggest that all or at least the great majority of this cross-linking occurs on trypsin digestible segments (or "tails") of the histones. The formation of oligomers over such extremely short distances and especially the observation of an H3 homodimer suggests a very close proximity of half-nucleosomes.

A new, relatively simple technique for the total invitro reconstitution of E. coli 50S ribosomes has been developed. It is a two-step procedure like that previously reported by Nierhaus and Dohme [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 71, 4713 (1974)], but it differs in a number of important aspects. Ribosomal RNA is prepared by direct phenol extraction of 70S particles to minimize nuclease fragmentation. A mixture of 50S proteins is prepared by acetic acid extraction and immediate removal of the acetic acid by thin film dialysis. The resulting protein mixture is soluble and stable. Separate RNA and protein fractions are mixed, incubated first at 44 degrees C in 7.5 mM Mg(2+), and then at 50 degrees C in 20 mM Mg(2+). The resulting 50S particles comigrate with native 50S particles in analytical gradients. They range from 50 to 100% active in five different functional assays. This is a fairly stringent test of the effectiveness of reconstitution since 50S particles derived from highly active vacant couples were used as a control.Images

Duplex DNA containing oligo(dG.dC)-rich clusters can be isolated by specific binding to poly(rC)-Sephadex. This binding, probably mediated by the formation of an oligo(dG.dC)rC+ triple helix, is optimal at pH 5 in 50% formamide, 2 M LiCl; the bound DNA is recovered by elution at pH 7.5. Using this method we find that the viral DNAs PM2, lambda and SV40 contain at least 1, 1 and 2 sites for binding to poly(rC)-Sephadex, respectively. These binding sites have been mapped in the case of SV40; the binding sites can in turn be used for physical mapping studies of DNAs containing (dG.dC) clusters. Inspection of the sequence of the bound fragments of SV40 DNA shows that a (dG.dC)6-7 tract is required for the binding of duplex DNA to poly(rC)-Sephadex. Although about 60% of rabbit DNA cleaved with restriction endonuclease KpnI binds to poly(rC)-Sephadex, no binding is observed for the 5.1 kb DNA fragment generated by KpnI digestion, which contains the rabbit beta-globin gene. This indicates that oligo(dG.dC) clusters are not found close to the rabbit beta-globin gene.

Crosslinking of DNA fibers by histone H1 or phosphorylated on Ser-37 histone H1, and by the individual fragments of the H1 polypeptide chain was studied by the method of turbidimetry. The dependence of the turbidity of DNA-protein complexes on the ionic strength in solution suggests that the condensation of H1.DNA complexes in vitro is apparently due to both specific histone-DNA interactions with the contribution of hydrogen and/or hydrophobic bonds and the formation of polycationic "bridges" fastening the DNA fibers. The effectiveness of the condensation is postulated to be a function of a proportion between the two mechanisms which in turn can be controlled by slight changes in ionic surroundings. The sharp dependence of shrinkage of H1.DNA complexes on ionic strength at "physiological" salt concentrations could provide a mechanism to regulate density and consequently the total activity of chromatin in the cell nuclei. The phosphorylation of histone H1 on Ser-37 by a specific histone kinase does not noticeably affect the pattern of DNA crosslinking by the H1.

An in vitro RNA-synthesizing system consisting of gently lysed E. coli cells on cellophane discs is described. The system has been optimalized with respect to total RNA synthesis. Under certain standard conditions DNA dependent RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) is responsible for the majority of the RNA synthesis. The extensive rifampicin sensitivity of the synthesis indicates that most of the transcripts are initiated in vitro. The RNA synthesizing system described here has been developed with the aim of studying phage transcription in vitro. We show here that lysates of a P4 infected P2 lysogen support initiation and propagation of transcription from the P2 prophage.

The less disabling phobias do not normally present a problem in that the stimulus may be avoided. This would also apply to hospital phobia until an acute medical or surgical problem might arise, when avoidance could constitute a direct threat to life. Although phobic illness is a common problem the small number of cases of hospital phobia recorded may represent the tip of the iceberg beneath which could be many phobic patients who deny their symptoms and risk their health because of their irrational fear. A case of hopsital phobia in a pregnant patient with suspected disproportion was treated by a rapid desensitization technique using hypnosis. After five sessions of 30 min each, the patient was symptom free. This simple method of desensitization, if more widely known would considerably minimize the risk caused by concealment of the phobic problem.

The effect of cultivation temperature and pH on growth of the culture Penicillium brevi-compactum and biosynthesis of extracellular phosphohydrolases (acid and alkaline RNases and acid PMEase) involved in RNA degradation was studied. The maximum growth of the culture was seen at 30 degrees and pA-7.0 and its maximum physiological activity with respect to the above enzymes was noted at 24 degrees and pH = 3.0, i.e. optimal conditions for the biosynthesis of phosphohydrolases did not coincide with those for the culture growth. The cultivation temperature and pH produced an effect on the oxygen consumption and synthesis of extracellular phosphohydrolases by the culture.

Highly purified poly(A) polymerase (polynucleotide adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.19), which synthesizes poly(A) from ATP substrate, can also catalyze hydrolysis of poly(A). The enzyme, designated as poly(A) hydrolase, requires either Mn2+ or Mg2+ for activity. Although AMP is the predominant product of the reaction, ADP and ATP are also formed. The enzyme is a 3'-exonuclease that does not degrade poly(A) associated with poly(A) poly(U) helical structure. AMP, ADP, and ATP inhibit the hydrolytic reaction. These data suggest that (i) the levels of adenine nucleotides regulate synthesis and degradation of poly(A), (ii) poly(A) itself is a storage form of adenine nucleotides, (iii) the hydrolytic reaction is responsible for poly(A) shortening or turnover observed in vivo, and (iv) the synthetic and hydrolytic activities are functions of the same protein molecule.

The kinetics, thermal stability and ultrasonic resistance of glucosoxidase from Penicillium vitale have been investigated. Its oxidative constant is close to, catalytic constant is 1.7 times less and the reductive constant is 5.4 times more than the respective constants of the enzyme from Aspergillus niger. The relationship between the thermal inactivation constant (k(i)=2.1 pT 15.3. The same relationship is true of the ultrasonic inactivation constant and pH in the pH range of 6.5-8.0. In a more acidic medium the rate of ultrasonic inactivation shows an insignificant dependence on pH. The mechanism of enzyme inactivation is discussed.

A protein was isolated from calf heart inner mitochondrial membrane with the aid of an electron paramagnetic resonance assay based on the relative binding properties of Ca2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ to the protein. The molecular weight of this protein has been estimated to be about 3000 by urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and amino acid analysis. The protein is shown to have two classes of binding sites for Ca2+ by flow dialysis studies and can extract Ca2+ into an organic phase. The selectivity sequence of this protein determined from the organic solvent extraction experiments shows that it favors divalent cations over monovalent cations. Also, the relative selectivity sequence for divalent cations is Ca2+, Sr2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Mg2+. Ruthenium red and La3+ are shown to inhibit the protein-mediated extraction of Ca2+ into the organic solvent. The calcium translocation in a Pressman cell by this protein is selectively driven by a hydrogen ion gradient. Control experiments indicate that the Ca2+ trnsport properties of the protein are not due to the contaminating phospholipids. It appears that we have isolated from the inner mitochondrial membrane a calcium carrier, which we have named "calciphorin."

31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of glycolyzing, anaerobic Escherichia coli cells and their perchloric acid extracts were obtained at 145.7 MHz. Time-dependent intracellular concentrations of nucleoside di- and triphosphates, Pi, and sugar phosphates were measured during glycolysis with 2-min resolution, while intracellular and extra-cellular pH values were monitored simultaneously. Upon glucose addition, anaerobic E. coli cells rapidly produce acids and develop a transmembrane pH gradient (delta pH). Glycolysis rates were calculated from the changes in the external pH. It was found that glycolysis rates are strongly dependent on internal pH, sharply decreasing when the pH drops below approximately 7.2. The ATPase inhibitor, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), prevented NTP hydrolysis and inhibited delta pH formation. The uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide p-triflouromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP), drastically reduced both the delta pH and the NTP level. When the cells were previously treated with DCCD, FCCP collapsed the delta pH while the NTP levels remained high. It is concluded that ATP produced by glycolysis is hydrolyzed by the membrane ATPase to generate a delta pH and that FCCP stimulates ATP hydrolysis by ATPase and collapses the proton gradient.

The pattern of action of effectors (AMP, IMP, CMP, anthranilic acid, tryptophane, alanine, glutamine, glycine, histidine) and glutamine synthetase (GS) extracted from the fodder yeast Candida tropicalis and stored at room temperature for 1.5-2 hrs was examined. As regards the action of effectors on GS after its exposure at room temperature, they can be subdivided into four groups: 1) the effector loses completely its inhibitory effect (glutamine, CMP, anthranilic acid in the synthetase reaction); 2) the inhibitory effect on the enzyme increases (AMP, IMP, anthranilic acid in the transferase reaction); 3) at low concentrations of the effector the peak of activation appears (tryptophane, GMP, alanine, glycine); 4) at low concentrations of the enzyme two peaks of activation appear (histidine). Similar results were obtained with the purified preparation of GS.

Because it was known that [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine can label alpha-adrenergic receptors as well as dopamine receptors, this study was done to establish the conditions under which [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine would be a reliable ligand for selective labeling of alpha-adrenergic receptors. The calf caudate was chosen because it contains both dopamine and adrenergic receptors, and 5 nM spiperone (spiroperidol) was used to block the neuroleptic/dopamine receptors. Thus, in the presence of spiperone, [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine exhibited saturable binding with a K(d) of 0.73 nM and a total number of sites of 150 fmol/mg of protein. The catechol neurotransmitters competed for [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding in the potencies order epinephrine > (-)-norepinephrine > dopamine, indicating that [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine (in the presence of 5 nM spiperone) was revealing alpha receptors. The alpha-adrenergic antagonists also competed for binding in the appropriate order: phentolamine > phenoxybenzamine > dibenamine. Finally, chlorpromazine was more potent than haloperidol in competing for [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine, also in accord with the properties of alpha receptors. These results with [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine as an alpha-adrenergic receptor ligand correlate well with those published by others for [(3)H]WB-4101.

Biochemical investigations were performed on autopsy tissues obtained from an 11-year-old girl who died with the juvenile, subacute neuropathic form of Gaucher disease. In addition to the expected deficiency of glucocerebrosidase activity, extracts of both liver and kidney from this individual displayed a profound (greater than or equal to 90%) deficiency of "soluble" beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase, and beta-galactosidase activities. Fibroblasts obtained from this individual also contained markedly reduced levels of beta-xylosidase activity but normal levels of beta-D-fucosidase and beta-galactosidase activity. Because the soluble beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase, and a portion of the beta-galactosidase activities from control human liver all cochromatographed on a gel filtration column of Sephadex G-200, it is suggested that these activities all reside in a single enzyme, analogous to the situation described in a number of nonhuman, mammalian tissues. This demonstration of multiple glycosidase deficiencies in addition to the deficiency of glucocerebrosidase in a case of subacute neuropathic Gaucher disease suggests that other biochemical aberrations, in addition to a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, might contribute to pathology in some cases of Gaucher disease.

Colicin K causes a rapid and drastic reduction of the membrane potential of Escherichia coli cells, as measured by the uptake of the lipophilic cation triphenylmethylphosphonium. The colicin causes no major changes in the pH gradient, as measured by the uptake of butyric acid. The decrease in membrane potential following addition of colicin K to the cells is a prompt response that parallels or precedes known physiological effects such as efflux of accumulated substrates. Hence the loss of membrane potential qualifies as the primary action by which the colicin uncouples membrane-associated function from respiration. Certain peculiarities of bacterial cells pretreated with EDTA in their response to uncoupling agents and lipophilic ions are described.

The levels of serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, tyrosine (TYR), norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate (GLU), aspartate (ASP), alanine, glycine (GLY) and taurine were measured in the CNS of adult male rats selectively inbred to the F8 generation for alcohol preference (P) and non-preference (NP). With respect to the values found in the NP group, higher levels of 5-HT, GABA, GLU and GLY and lower levels of ASP were found in the diencephalon-mesencephalon (D-M) and higher levels of NE were found in the telencephalon (TEL) of the P group. The animals in the P and NP strains were further subdivided into two additional groups, one given only H2O (W) and the second given 10% ethanol (A) during a one week period, thereby producing four groups (NP-W, NP-A, P-W and P-A). With these conditions, the level of (a) TYR in the D-M was higher in the P-A and NP-A animals than in the P-W and NP-W groups respectively; (b) 5-HT in the TEL was higher in the NP-A group than NP-W group; and (c) GABA in the TEL was higher in the P-A than P-W animals. No differences were observed in the cerebellum between the two strains or between the subgroups within each strain. The present study also demonstrated that the P animals will work in an operant situation to obtain 10% ethanol, even when H2O is freely available, and will voluntarily bar-press up to 6-7 times for each ethanol reinforcement.

A methodological concept for measuring anxiety states and changes in anxiety states in clinical studies with anxiolytic substances is presented: Effectivity should be evaluated on several levels which include emotions, objects of anxiety, psychophysiology, biochemistry, and observed behavior. This test concept is based on new knowledge from behavior psychology, learning theory, psychology of testing, psychophysiology, biochemistry, neuroendocrinology, and psychiatry. In diagrams, important mechanisms of thr origin of experimental, stress-induced and pathological anxiety states are depicted. The point is stressed that anxiety is situational and fluctuates.

The anxiolytic and sedative properties of a thienodiazepine (clotiazepam) were investigated in 40 healthy subjects with varying degrees of arousal and with the aid of specific anxiety-inducing conditions. A cross-over design with a double blind technique was used. EEG, heart and respiratory rate, peripheral pulse volume and skin resistance were measured during the anxiety-inducing conditions with the visualization of neutral and fearful situations as well as with the threat of shock. The mood, physical sensations and behaviour tendencies of the test subjects were determined by self-rating questionnaires. The anxiolytic and sedative effects of the thienodiazepine under study were able to be differentiated as far as subjective perception and autonomic responses were concerned. The development of sedative and anxiolytic effects is dependent on the subject's state of arousal. Situations involving the anticipation of anxiety are sufficient as proof of pharmacogenic anxiolysis. The tranquilizer reduces anxiety and physical tension, but does not influence the timing of autonomic readiness responses, and thus does not affect the coping strategies.

A rapid non-invasive test for the presence of B. melaninogenicus in the wounds of crepitant non-clostridial gangrene is described. The wounds are viewed under an ultraviolet light, and the presence of bright red fluorescene indicates the probable presence of B. melaninogenicus.

The effect of the new 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam on visual evoked potentials (VEP) and spontaneous EEG in the conscious rabbit and on spinal polysynaptic reflexes in the decerebrated cat was studied in comparison to the 1,4-benzodiazepine diazepam. Clobazam was half as potent as diazepam in depressing the amplitude of visual evoked potentials in the nonanaesthetized rabbit, whereas the depressing effect on spinal polysynaptic reflexes in the decerebrated cat was only 1/7 --1/30 of the diazepam effect. The action of clobazam and diazepam on VEP also showed differences in time course, i.e., the peak effect of clobazam lasted from 1 to 6 h after application, whereas the effect of diazepam appeared after 10 min and declined already after 1 h. Both compounds had similar effects on computer-analyzed spontaneous EEG in the rabbit (power spectrum analysis), with an increase of power in the beta-band (13-39Hz) and a decrease in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and theta (4-8Hz) bands.

The present paper reviews the role of antianxiety agents in the treatment of nonpsychotic anxious patients. Major emphasis is placed on findings from clinical trials conducted by this research group. Consideration is given to the relative efficacy of available antianxiety agents, to patients response in relation to patterns of symptomatology, and to the degree of symptom relief experienced by drug-treated anxious patients. Also discussed are some of the many nonspecific factors that affect improvement with drug treatment in general and with the benzodiazepines in particular. It is concluded that many anxious patients are not currently receiving adequate drug treatment, and may require longer periods of drug therapy or supplemental nondrug intervention.

30 patients suffering from therapy-resistant chronic pain were divided into three groups according to drive and mood: I. psychomotor inhibition combined with depressive mood, II. agitation and depressive mood, III. agitation combined normal mood. The psychopharmacological treatment of pain showed sufficient results, when the drugs were directed to the target symptoms "agitation", "lack of drive", and "depression". The differentiated administration of activating or sedative antidepressants and neuroleptics caused reduction or absence of pain while the routine administration of neuroleptics (i.e. chlorpromazine) was less effective.

In vitro cholesteryl synthesis from oleic acid [1-14C] was studied with enzyme preparations from human thoracic aorta and liver. Results from studies on the properties of the esterifying system provide good evidence that the mechanism involves fatty acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyl transferase. In studies on human thoracic aorta with varying degrees of atherosclerotic disease, and pairs of normal and diseased aorta from the same subject, there was no obvious relationship between aortic cholesteryl esterifying activity and severity of atheroma. Normal aorta from two young males, presumably free of atherosclerosis, had relatively very low esterifying activity. In the six liver samples tested, there was negligible esterifying activity, in contrast to the high activity seen in the case of rat liver. For the thin layer chromatographic isolation of the labeled cholesteryl oleate a solvent system of isooctane:diethyl ether (100:6) was found to give a better separation of the ester than the petroleum ether: diethylether:acetic acid system generally used.

Ion-sensitive microelectrodes were used to record intracellular pH, Na+ and Cl- in snail neurones. NaCl or HCl was injected iontophoretically to compare the Na pump with the pHi regulating system. The Na pump was inhibited by ouabain, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone and increasing the membrane potential, whereas the pHi regulating system was relatively unaffected. Activation of the Na pump had no effect on pHi whereas activation of the pHi recovery process increased internal Na+. Activation of the pHi recovery process by CO2 application increased internal Na+ and also decreased internal Cl-. The results show that there is no direct connexion between the Na pump and the pHi recovery process, and that the pHi recovery process is electroneutral, and appears not to require metabolic energy. The results also confirm that the pHi recovery process involves the influx of Na+ ions and the efflux of Cl- ions.

The anti-anaphylactic effects of four potential anti-allergic agents (DSCG: disodium cromoglycate, PRD-92-EA, M&B 22,948 and DECC: diethylcarbamazine citrate) were studied on cardiovascular responses of acute systemic anaphylaxis and chemical mediators of immediate hypersensitivity in chickens. Compounds M&B 22,948, PRD-92-EA, DSCG and DECC all inhibited cardiovascular manifestations of systemic anaphylaxis in domestic fowl. High doses of Compounds PRD-92 EA, M&B 22,948 and DECC also exhibited a nonspecific receptor blocking activity towards exogenously administered chemical mediators of anaphylaxis.

When temperature changes are superimposed on changes in the control variables of acid-base state (PCO2, strong ion difference), the understanding of acid-base changes becomes difficult. A solution has recently been proposed for blood (Malan, 1977); it was based on the assumption that closed system conditions correspond to a minimal change in the overall acid-base state when temperature varies. The feasibility of extending these concepts to muscle intracellular acid-base vs temperature relationships is evaluated on the basis of a model study; the errors made by replacing closed conditions (which require knowledge of chemical composition) by more convenient approximations are estimated. A representation of both extracellular and intracellular acid-base data on a temperature-corrected bicarbonate-pH diagram is derived. It allows the interpretation of variable-temperature intracellular acid-base changes in terms of changes in control variables, 'respiratory (PCO2) or 'metabolic' (strong ion difference).

Against the background of classical observations made 50 years ago, a brief review is offered of some of the work performed in the author's laboratory on the behavior of weak acids and bases towards living animal cells. The significance of membrane permeability of the charged partner of these electrolytes is pointed out, and the existence of an active process of H+ extrusion (or its equivalent) in response to acid loading is demonstrated. The effect of intracellular inhomogeneity on weak acid and base transmembrane distribution is examined. The significance of these variables for weak acid- or base-derived intracellular pH is discussed.

Intracellular pH in single muscle fibres from Balanus nubilus was determined, both by the weak acid distribution method (using 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidine dione) and by means of a glass pH microelectrode, following prolonged equilibrations in normal, acid or alkaline Ringer solutions. In the DMO method [3H]inulin was combined with [14C]DMO so that an extracellular space could be calculated for each 'DMO space' on each fibre. Less than ideal uptake curves were obtained both for [14C]DMO and [3H]inulin, yet the calculated pHi compared favourably with the microelectrode pHi, especially when the DMO-pHi was calculated from [14C]DMO and [3H]inulin values obtained by extrapolating the 'plateaus' of the uptake curves to time zero. The Waddell and Butler equation was examined to determine why acceptable pHi values should be forthcoming from less than ideal uptake data.

Mepyramine maleate, aminophenazone, nialamide and chloroquine phosphate are examples of compounds which do not fulfil the requirements of the delta A method. By the proper choice of polynomial and wavelengths, the deltapj method has been successfully applied to their determination. The mean percentage recoveries were found to be 100.2 +/- 0.8, 99.6 +/- 0.6, 99.1 +/- 1.7 and 100.4 +/- 1.3, respectively.

The nature of pH changes with temperature is similar in both air-breathing and water-breathing poikilotherms having a pH-temperature slope of -0.015 to 0.020 U/degrees C. The means by which this is accomplished are quite different in the two groups. The air-breather behaves in vivo as a Rosenthal, or constant CO2 content system, with PaCO2 increasing at higher temperatures. The increase in PaCO2 is brought about by a reduction in the ration VE/MCO2. The water-breather, on the other hand, does not change VG/MO2, so as not to sacrifice oxygen delivery, and consequently does not control PaCO2 by ventilation and perhaps does not control it at all. Instead, the ratio of CT/SCO2 is controlled by altering blood bicarbonate concentration. Since alteraction of Na+ and Cl- uptake rates affects blood pH, and alterations of blood pH affect uptake of Na+ and Cl- at the gills, the carrier-mediated Na+/H+(NH4+) and Cl-/HCO3-(OH-) mechanisms now known to occur in gills appear to be the primary pH-regulating mechanism in water-breathers. Our knowledge of the role of gut and kidney in pH regulation is incomplete, but on the basis of preliminary information the kidney does not appear to respond to acid challenge.

Experiments are reviewed in which intracellular pH (pHi), during exposure of a cell to CO2- or NH3-containing solutions, not only undergoes an acidification of alkalinization, respectively, but tends to return toward its original value and, upon removal of the test solution, rebounds to a value more alkaline or acid, respectively, than the initial one. A simple physiochemical model is discussed which interprets these observations both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the case of NH3-induced transients, only passive movements seem to take place; in the CO2-induced transients one must postulate an active 'proton pump'. Experimentally verifiable predictions can be made from these models. It is suggested that many physiological effects follow exposure to CO2 or NH3 may be subject to similar transients and rebounds.

In the quantification of buffering the distinct roles of bicarbonate and of other buffers must be taken into account. The determination of the total non-bicarbonate buffer value, betaa, in intact tissues is complicated by active pH regulation and by heterogeneity of cytoplasm with respect to betaa, while heterogeneity with respect to pH in vivo could cause errors in estimates made with homogenates. Available estimates of betaa are discussed, as are the individual contributions of proteins, dipeptides and phosphates. A high betaa is appropriate in cells which sometimes have high rates of glycolysis, or which buffer extracellular fluid, but non-protein buffer concentrations can be well below the limits imposed by osmolarity, perhaps because buffering can upset ionic gradients.

Basic physical principles and concepts plus computer-implemented numberical techniques now make possible a thorough quantitative analysis of acid-base systems. Some important conclusions from that analysis are presented: 1. Acid-base balance for physiological solutions hould be defined as the value of [OH-]/[H+]. 2. pH is a dangerously misleading indirect representation of [H+]. 3. Strong electrolytes affect [H+] and other deendent acid-base variables primarily through their resultant, the strong ion difference. 4 Hydrogen ion concentration in biological solutions is determined by the strong ion difference, the carbon dioxide partial pressure, and the total weak acid present. Changes in hydrogen ion concentration can be broght about only by changing one or more of these three independent variables. The same statements apply to all the other dependent variables, notably bicarbonate ion concentration. None of the dependent variables determines any other dependent variable, although their quantitative behaviors are necessarily correlected. 5. Solutions separated by membranes can interact in acid-base terms only by processes which alter the values of their independent variables. Interaction of intra- and extracellular acid-base balance can only occur by the cell membrane altering these independent variables in the extracellular fluid and in the cytosol.

When the interior of a squid giant axon is loaded with acid, the cell responds by extruding that acid in an energy-requiring process. Our results indicate that this acid extrusion is accomplished by exchanging external HCO3- for internal Cl- at the expense of ATP.

The 5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione (DMO) method for the determination of intracellular pH has been adapted to Acer pseudoplatanus cells cultivated in liquid medium. DMO is metabolized by these cells and this parameter has to be taken into account in the measurement of the intracellular concentration of free DMO. As the cells contain a large acidic vacuolar compartment, the intracellular pH estimated from the DMO technique is an overall pHi', the dependence of which on various cytoplasmic and vacuolar characteristics has been discussed. Important modifications of these overall pHi values under the influence of CO2 or NH4+ have been measured. These pHi modifications strongly affect the regulation of cell division through the control of the intracellular concentration of hormones of the auxin type.

The possible neural effects of adenosine were investigated by using electrophysiological techniques at the level of some central and peripheral synapses. The evoked potentials in the somatosensorial cerebral cortex are influenced according to both the type of administration and the level of the electrical stimulation. While the local application does not induce significant alterations, the intrathalamic injections and the perfusion of the IIIrd cerebral ventricle do change the distribution of activated units at the level of different cortical layers especially during the peripheral stimulation. The frequency of spontaneous miniature discharges intracellularly recorded in the neuromuscular junction (mepp) is significantly depressed by adenosine. This effect is calcium- and dose-dependent. The end plate potentials (EPP) were also depressed. The statistical binomial analysis of the phenomenon indicated that adenosine induces a decrease if the presynaptic pool of the available transmitter. The data obtained demonstrate a presynaptic inhibitory action of adenosine beside its known vascular and metaholic effects.

In experiments on dogs the intravenous injection of heterogenous blood resulted in a decrease of total arterial pressure, weakening of the brain blood flow, fall of Po2 and pH in the brain cortex. A simultaneous constriction if inner carotid arteries is depending on direct action on the vascular wall of heterogenous proteins and on a release in it of physiologically active substances, such as serotonin. Fine pial arteries were dilated by the compensatory mechanism that was not associated with a decrease of intravascular and with direct action of hypoxia or acid metabolites on vascular walls. It was proposed that the trigger mechanism of this vasodilatation is hypoxic changes of metabolism in the nervous tissue.

The basal and gastrin-stimulated gastric acid output was measured in rats with a distal splenocaval shunt. In addition, serum gastrin levels were determined in rats with splenocaval and portacaval shunts. The rise in gastric acid output with increasing gastrin dosage was the same in rats with splenocaval shunt as in the controls. Serum gastrin levels were not influenced by portocaval or splenocaval shunting.

Improvements in the field of sealants and of adhesive restorations based thereon represent the most important new development in preventive dentistry. Caries prevention by means of better nutritional habits is greatly enhanced by newly developed and marketed sugar-free and tooth sparing products. Statistical mortality studies have again demonstrated that prevention by means of fluorides constitutes no danger to public health. Considerable advances have been made in the field of fluoridation of domestic salt. Newer Scandinavian studies revealed that intensive care programs with children including dental hygiene sessions every 3-5 weeks resulted in moderate decreases of caries incidence. By contrast, intensive care programs with adults were extremely successful. By means of 4-6 recall sessions with dental hygienists it was possible to completely stop periodontal destruction for 4, even for 7 years. Apart from initial restorative and conservative dental work, the success of periodontal treatment may be guaranteed only by prevention of recurring gingivitis. Extensive dental statistics from Switzerland reveal a marked success of applied preventive dental medicine. The work of dental practitioners is by now greatly influenced by the new scientific insight gained from research in the prevention of dental disease.

Fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes from eight patients with congenital agammaglobulinemia demonstrate reduced ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity when compared to the mean activity of normal subjects and patients with other forms of immunoglobulin deficiency. A specific defect of ecto-5'-nucleotidase is further suggested by normal values for lymphocyte ecto-adenosinetriphosphatase and ecto-nonspecific phosphatase. The data provide evidence for an enzyme deficiency in this X-linked, B lymphocyte deficiency syndrome.

The activity of GM1 beta-galactosidase in the brain and liver of patients with GM1-gangliosidosis was assayed using GM1-ganglioside tritiated in the terminal galactose. In the cases of GM1-gangliosidosis Types 1 and 2A the activity was less than 0.5% of the control. In the liver of GM1-gangliosidosis Type 2B the activity was observed to be much higher than that of Types 1 and 2A. On Sephadex G-150 gel filtration, three active fractions (I, II and III) for 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-galactopyranoside (4MU) and two active fractions (I and II) for GM1-ganglioside were obtained in the control liver. There was no active fraction for GM1-ganglioside in spite of the preserved fraction I for 4MU in the liver of GM1-gangliosidosis Type 1 or Type 2A. In any of the three cases fraction II for both 4MU and G71-ganglioside was not detected.

The experiment is aimed at establishing the consequences of the endotoxic stress (TAB) associated with alpha- or beta-adrenergic selective blocking drugs on the course of the acute irradiation disease in rats (700R, gamma rad Co60). TAB administered before or after irradiation, alone or associated with propranolol, increases the surviving rate at 30 and 60 days from exposure as compared to the controls (LD 95/30 days). Generally, dibenzyline has unfavourable effects on mortality and survival rate at the mentioned intervals. Based on the data obtained, an adrenergic component is analysed in achieving the survival increase by TAB and beta-adrenergic blocking substances; a hypothesis about the mechanisms involved is advanced.

From the observations on 18 patients and the experiments on 77 dogs with experimental pancreatitis neuro-humoral interrelations and hydrocortisone effect upon the respiratory function have been studied. Both in the clinic and in the experiment the authors have found the intermediate metabolism disturbed: adrenaline-like substances blood level rises, while the cholinergic complex blood level drops dramatically. The conclusion on a vital importance of a consecutive neuro-humoral correction with the use of cholinomimetics and corticosteroids in pancreatitis is drawn.

The experience with the surgical treatment of 305 cases of cryptorchism is presented. 108 Keetly and Torek's operations and 22 Mixter's operations have proved that in surgical technic the main emphasis should be transferred to the mobilization of the spermatic cord elements, but the orchoifixation should be simple and atraumatic. The Fowler's method of the descent of the testicles (107) in superficial inguinal ectopy and various modifications of the Petriwalsky's method of the descent of the testicles (43) in high inguinal retention and abdominal cryptorchism have made a favorable impression.

Adult male Sprague Dalwey rats on which end-to-side portacaval shunt (PCS) operation was performed did not hyperplastic nodules and hepatoms when they were fed 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene in semisynthetic basal diet for periods of up to 169 days. In contrast, all the intact rats fed the same diet for only 75 days, developed hyperplastic nodules in the liver. Transferred to normal pellet for another 25 days, hepatomas developed in 100% of these animals. The amount of protein-bond 3'-Me-DAB was found to be much smaller in operated rats than in intact animals. The glutathione (GSH) level in PCS-operated rats was lower than in intact controsl. A single large dose of 3'-Me-DAB led to the increase of only about 30% in the concentration of GSH during the period of 24-48 h, compared to the increase of 50-100% in non-operated rats. No clear tendency to a gradual increase in the activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was noted in PCS-operated rats during the period of 5 1/2 months of 3'-Me-DAB feeding. The increase in GT-ase activity never exceeded 30% above the level of GT-ase in the livers of PCS-operated rats fed basal diet without the carcinogen. This striking inhibibiton of GT-ase increase induced by 3'Me-DAB in PCS-operated rats contrasted with an increase of GI-ase activity by 5,000% found in livers of non-operated rats with hyperplastic nodules after 75 days of 3'-Me-DAB feeding and the increase by up to 10,000% in developed hepatomas. These effects and the inhibition of 3'Me-DAB-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, manifested by lack preneoplastic morphologic changes and the absecnce of hepatomas in rats after PCS, can best be explained by functional deficiency of the liver to metabolize the procarcinogen 3'-Me-DAB into an activated carcinogen.

At the esophago-cardiac junction squamous epithelium is intermingled with gastric epithelium. Within the lamina propria of the distal 3 cm of the esophagus we found cardiac glands with many argyrophil cells in 60% of cases. Electron microscopy revealed seven well knonwn types and two further forms which we could not identify: EC, ECL, D, D1, AL, I eg. M, S. It is supposed that these cells are modified neurotransmitters with a local activity. Their function is local regulation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

A novel procedure for storing blood at a controlled pH consists in collecting blood in a pH 8.20, Tris-CPD solution and storing it in a special recipient including a gas permeable membrane under a CO2 atmosphere. The recipient is placed in an atmosphere of variable CO2 content, so that the initial alkalinity of the preservative is balanced by dissolved CO2, the proportion of which is diminished when lactate production increases with storage. 2,3-DPG and ATP were studied at three different pH levels of approximately 7.25, 7.45, and 7.65 at 4 degrees C. The best pH for the simultaneous maintenance of 2,3-DPG and ATP was 7.65. Under these conditions, 2,3-DPG is maintained at its initial level and ATP at 55% of its initial level at the 30th day. Lactate production is linear and hemolysis moderate.

A bacterium isolated from Burdwan (India) soil was found to accumulate L-valine in the growth medium and identified to be a strain of Bacillus subtilis. The strain is able to grow and accumulate valine in a purely synthetic medium, but supplementation of the synthetic medium with either Casamino acids or yeast extract or with both, significantly improves the yield. The entire fermentation period can be divided into a growth phase and a production phase, which can be prolonged by adjustment of pH to the neutral range. Among the different carbon and nitrogen sources tested glucose at 8.5% and L-glutamic acid at 0.8%, respectively, were found most suitable. Cane sugar molasses tested as a substitute for glucose significantly stimulated growth but valine production was less. Different vitamins tested stimulated growth and valine yield and an inoculum level of 10% (v/v) of the medium was found to be optimal. The yield of valine under optimal conditions was found to be 4.53 g per litre of the medium. Valine has been isolated in crystalline form from the fermented broth by ion exchange resin chromatography and found to be a pure sample of the L-isomer.

The authors have studied the effects of hormonal and neurotopic agents on ovulation and on the fetus in the preimplantation period.  The experiments were done on 100 female rats divided in 5 groups.  The 1st group received megestranol in a contraceptive dosage; the 2nd group was administered half of the contraceptive dosage of megestranol; the 3d group received spasmolitin, the 4th a combination of megestranol and spasmolitin, and the 5th group served as a control.  Male rats were placed with the females after 2 weeks of treatment.  The time of conception was determined by the presence of spermatozoa in vaginal smears.  Megestranol was found to increase the quantity of corpus luteum, while the combination of twice as much megestranol with spasmolitin did not have any effect on the corpus luteum.  Within 60 hours following the fecundation the fetuses were found in all rats to be in the 2nd-4th stage.  The number of normal and degenerated fetuses did not significantly differ from 1 group to the next.  In the control group, 5% of the blastocysts showed signs of degeneration; this rate was 23.5% in the rats who were given the combination of spasmolitin and megestranol, and 70% in the rats who received contraceptive dosages of megestranol.  These reulsts show that megestranol and combinations of megestranol and spasmolitin affect the ovulation and the development of impregnated ovules.

Circulating immune complexes were determined in patients with acute viral hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis and periarteriitis nodosa with the Raji cell technique. Circulating immune complexes were found in 11/18 HBsAg positive and HBsAg negative cases of acute viral hepatitis. In HBsAg positive chronic active hepatitis immune complexes were detectable in 42/43 cases but only in 1/27 HBsAg negative cases. Ten healthy HBsAg carriers demonstrated no detectable immune complexes. Using FITC conjugated antisera against HBs, HBc, and e antigen, immune complexes could not be found in any case of acute viral hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis. Elution of immune complexes from Raji demonstrated IgG, C'3 and a lack of HBsAg, HBc or e antigen. Immune complexes were present in 4/8 cases with periarteriitis nodosa. Viral components were detectable in one case.

Changes in cerebral cortex concentrations of high-energy phosphates, glycolytic metabolites, citric acid cycle intermediates, associated amino acids, and ammonia, were studied after 5, 15 and 30 min of incomplete ischemia in rats anesthetized with 70% N2O or 150 mg.kg-1 of phenobartibal. Previous results have shown that with this type of ischemia (bilateral carotid artery occlusion combined with reduction in blood pressure to 50 mm Hg) cortical blood flow is reduced to below 10% of nitrous oxide values, whether animals are anesthetized with 70% N2O or 150 mg.kg-1 of phenobarbital. In animals under 70% N2O, changes in tissue concentrations of phosphocreatine, ATP, ADP and AMP were similar to those previously obtained in complete ischemia. However, some glucose remained in the tissue, and the lactate concentrations gradually rose to reach excessive values. Changes occuring in glycolytic and citric acid cycle intermediates were similar to those seen in complete ischemia but, after 30 min, there was some reduction in the pool size of amino acids. In those animals given phenobarbital and which lost all EEG activity during ischemia, changes in cerebral metabolites were virtually identical to those observed in nitrous oxide-anesthetized animals. However, some animals exposed to 5 or 15 min of ischemia had some remaining EEG activity. In these, cerebral energy state was significantly less deranged, and levels of glycogen, glucose and pyruvate were higher.

In 156 experiments performed on 41 cats with adequate experimental models of pseudoneurotic conditions, states of anxiety due to an electrostimulation of the hypothalamus through implanted electrodes and an emotional stress due to a conflict situation the authors compared the individual traits of the psychotropic activity of lorazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, nirazepam. These experiments permitted to display significant differences of psychophysiological structures in the tranquilizing effect of 5 benzodiazepine derivatives.

A histochemical technique for demonstrating leucocyte alkaline phosphatase activity (LAP), based on direct precipitation of lead phosphate at pH 9.5, is described. The effect of fixative, temperature and stability of the medium on the activity of the enzyme and stability of the colour reaction was thoroughly studied. Peripheral blood smears obtained from both normal humans and pathological cases were studied and the results were compared with these obtained by the azo-dye method.

Vasoconstrictory responses to noradrenaline (NA) or high potassium chloride (130 mM) usually show a biphasic behaviour: an initial peak is followed by a lower steady state level. The influence of three beta-sympatholytic agents (propranolol, pindolol, practolol) and a "Ca-antagonist" (verapamil) on this particular behaviour of KCl-induced vasoconstrictions was compared with responses to NA. Studies were performed on the intact vascular bed of an isolated intestinal preparation of the rat. 1. Increases in the concentration of propranolol and pindolol from 10(-10) to 10(-6) M attenuated the vascular responses to high KCl. Practolol, however, distinctly enhanced the KCl-responses. NA (1.3 microgram/ml)-elicited vasoconstriction was found to be influenced in a similar manner by the beta-receptor antagonists used, though lower concentrations of pindolol had an enhancing, higher concentrations a reducing effect on the constrictory responses to NA. 2. The extent to which the biphasic response adjusted to the steady state level was concentration-dependently increased KCl-responses and significantly decreased to a monophasic response to NA, in the presence of the beta-sympatholytic agents. 3. By using a quotient of deltaPs (steady-state phase) to deltaPi (initial vasoconstriction) and by comparing the effect of the three beta-sympatholytic agents with that of verapamil on this quotient showed a concentration-dependent decrease in presence of the beta-sympatholytic as well as of the Ca-antagonistic agents. These myotropic actions, i.e. negative influences on the mechanism of vascular smooth muscle activation ranged in the following sequence: Verapamil greater than propranolol greater than pindolol greater than practolol. 4. The mechanism underlying the biphasic responses to high potassium chloride are concluded to be basically different from the NA-responses because they are inversely affected by beta-sympatholytic agents. The steady-state response to KCl was found to be very sensitive to non-specific pharmacological actions of beta-sympatholytic substances. The myotropic action of the beta-receptor antagonists is compared with that of the Ca-antagonist verapamil and the role of calcium in the mechanism of activation of vascular smooth muscle is discussed.

Experiments were designed to investigate responses of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (PTH) during alpha-adrenergic stimulation and blockade in cows. Alpha-adrenergic agonists (methoxamine, phenylephrine and noradrenaline, the beta-adrenergic action of which was blocked by propranolol) did not change PTH and free fatty acid levels, whereas they characteristically increased the blood pressure and decreased the heart rate. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic blockade by phentolamine progressively increased PTH levels. The elevated PTH concentrations, associated with increased plasma noradrenaline and free fatty acid levels, rising heart rate and decreasing blood pressure, indicated that all these changes can be related to a beta-adrenergic stimulatory mechanism. Beta-adrenergic stimulation was presumably responsible for the initial elevation of PTH concentrations, whereas, during the later phase of the phentolamine infusions, a concomitant hypocalcaemia probably also produced a stimulatory effect.

Testicular blood flow and testosterone concentrations in the spermatic venous plasma were measured on unilaterally cryptorchid rats. Blood flow to the cryptorchid testis was 31.4 +/- 11.7 (SD) ml/100 g X min which was significantly higher thant that of the scrotal testis (17.7 +/- 4.4 ml/100 g X min). Stereological analysis showed a relative increase of blood vessel containing interstitial tissue in the cryptorchid testis, which was probably the main factor responsible for the relative increase of blood flow to the cryptorchid testis. The increase of interstitial tissue was greater than the increase of blood vessels and thus, the interstitium in the cryptorchid testis contained a number of vessels which was smaller than that of the interstitium in the scrotally located testis. The concentration of testosterone in the spermatic vein of the abdominal testis was 18.0 +/- 5.5 (SD) ng/ml and the corresponding value for the scrotal testis was 41.2 +/- 7.0 ng/ml. Calculations based on functional and morphological data indicate that the function of the Leydig cells in the abdominal testis was impaired. It was concluded that the outflow of testosterone from the cryptorchid testis was highly reduced.

The authors studied the changes of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in rabbits respectively subjected to bleeding, hypobaric hypoxia and CoCl2 treatment; in such conditions a rise of the enzyme activity was observed. Similar increases take place also as a consequence of intravenous infusions carried out by using lactic or hydrochloric acid. The authors suggest that these increases in the erythrocyte AChE activity are connected with the decrease of the pCO2 that occurs in the various experimental conditions achieved.

Haemorrhagic shock was induced in anaesthetized dogs by bleeding them into a blood reservoir system. By adjusting the blood level of the reservoir at a certain distance over the heart level the mean arterial blood pressure was kept at 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg). As has been found earlier, massive doses of hydrocortisone (80-560 mg.kg-1 body weight) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the total peripheral resistance. The degree of vasodilation distinctly increased during concomitant alpha-receptor blockade induced by phenoxybenzamine. The beta-receptor blocking drug propranolol efficiently inhibited the vasodilation caused by hydrocortisone and phenoxybenzamine. The findings fit with the hypothesis that massive doses of hydrocortisone induce an increased stimulation of the adrenergic beta2-receptors of the vascular smooth muscles.

Fazadinium bromide (AH 8165) is a new non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of effect. The characteristics of the neuromuscular blockade induced were compared in normal and renal failure patients by monitoring the mechanical responses of thumb adductor muscle to ulnar nerve stimulation. The data suggest that renal failure, even in anephric patients, does not influence the depth of neuromuscular relaxation when judged from the identical dose-effect curves in both groups of patients. Moreover, the duration of the neuromuscular block was not significantly increased in end-stage kidney failure patients, whether the initial or late phases of the spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular transmission were considered, and this occurred over the entire therapeutic range. However, additional incremental injections of fazadinium bromide should be used cautiously, as evidence appeared of prolonged duration of action. This agent, fazadinium bromide, may therefore present useful advantages to other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents as to clinical safety and effects in patients with renal insufficiency.

In 22 comatose patients with acute brain injury, the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was calculated as the product of the hemispheric cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the arteriovenous oxygen content difference. All patients were subjected to moderate sedation without barbiturates, normothermia and respiratory treatment. The CBF was calculated by the 133xenon washout method as the average of 16 regions. The results indicate high jugular venous oxygen tension and, in some studies, very low oxygen consumption. A critical, low CMRO2 was not found, and values of about 0.4 ml/100 g/min were compatible with restitution of intellectual function. The CMRO2 was unrelated to the clinical outcome and to the time after the trauma. In bilateral studies, the lowest values were measured in the most severely injured hemisphere.

In 18 unconscious patients with traumatic brain injury, the cerebral autoregulation was tested during the first 2-3 weeks after the acute trauma. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by the intra-arterial 133xenon washout method before and after an increase of about 20% in the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) by angiotensin. The difference between MABP and intraventricular pressure (IVP) was used as cerebral perfusion pressure (PP). Simultaneously, ventricular fluid pH, lactate and pyruvate were measured. Regional loss of autoregulation indicated by a 20% flow increase was observed in 29 out of 35 studies (83%), while hemispheric loss of autoregulation was observed in only one study. The results of the autoregulation tests were unrelated to the clinical outcome, the presence of brain-stem lesion, and the ventricular fluid pH, lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio. In repeated studies, a gradual normalization of the autoregulation was observed about 5 days after the acute trauma.

The haemodynamic effects of massive doses of hydrocortisone (80-320 mg.kg-1), methylprednisolone (4-32 mg.kg-1), betamethasone (1.6-12.8 mg.kg-1) and aldosterone (0.1-0.8 mg.kg-1) and the interaction with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol have been studied during controlled haemorrhagic shock in the anaesthetized dog. Hydrocortisone was the only steroid which showed any significant vasodilating ability when given alone. The alpha-receptor blocking agent phenoxybenzamine distinctly decreased the total peripheral resistance. The effect of the phenoxybenzamine was increased in combination with hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone, especially if the steroid was given as the first drug. The vasodilation found was efficiently abolished by the beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol. The ability of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone to potentiate phenoxybenzamine was not shared by betamethasone or aldosterone. Thus, the haemodynamic effect of the steroid does not seem to be correlated to either a glucocorticoid nor a mineralocorticoid effect. It is suggested that the steroid effect studied is related to the ability of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone to block the extra neuronal amine uptake which decreases the rate of elimination of the sympathetic transmitter from the vicinity of the adrenergic receptor of the vascular smooth muscle.

Mechanical and electrical responses of spontaneously contracting muscle strips from oestrogen dominated rabbit uterus were investigated by the sucrose gap method. The effects of isoprenaline and dibutyryl-c-AMP in the presence and absence of propranolol were tested. It has been shown previously that the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline inhibits the spontaneously contracting uterus even in the presence of the beta-blocker propranolol. The rise in c-amp which is caused by isoprenaline, is, however, blocked by propranolol. The aim of this investigation was to study further the role of c-AMP in the isoprenaline-induced relaxation of the uterus. Isoprenaline (10(-6) M) consistently abolished spikes and mechanical contractions, usually accompanied by hyperpolarization. Propranolol (3 X 10(-6) M) markedly reduced the incidence of hyperpolarization, but did not affect the other actions of isoprenaline. Hyperpolarization does not seem to be a prerequisite for inhibition of uterine contraction. Dibutyryl-c-AMP mimicked the actions of isoprenaline. No positive evidence to support a hypothesis of a c-AMP-independent mechanism was found. Therefore a possible explanation of the results could be that isoprenaline increases c-AMP in a small intracellular pool, mediating electrical and mechanical responses but not influenced by propranolol.

The serotonin (5-HT) content of enterochromaffin cells (EC) was studied by a cytofluorimetric method in biopsies from rat duodenal mucosa after in vitro incubation with different adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists and acetylcholine (ACh). Noradrenaline (NA), Adrenaline (A) and Isoprenaline (IP) caused a decrease of 5-HT in EC down to 40--60% and for NA and A this effect was concentration-dependent. The effect was antagonized by d,1-propranolol but not by d-propranolol, metoprolol, phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine indicating that the 5-HT release from EC is probably mediated via a true beta-adrenoceptor mechanism possibly of the beta2 type. ACh also decreased the 5-HT content of EC but was much less potent than the adrenergic substances. Dopamine (DA) had no effect.

Flunitrazepam in 2-mg and 4-mg doses was compared with flurazepam 30 mg and nitrazepam 10 mg for hypnotic efficacy in a double-blind, multiple cross-over trial involving 41 psychiatric in-patients. In the vast majority of comparisons involving a number of sleep parameters differences did not reach significance level. Flunitrazepam 4 mg tended to produce the shortest latency time and the longest duration of sleep but also the most side-effects. Nitrazepam 10 mg appeared to have a slight advantage over the other drugs in terms of patient preference. For severe sleep disturbance flunitrazepam 2 mg tended to be the most satisfactory drug in terms of efficacy and paucity of side-effects.

This article discusses the results of recent neuroendocrinological research in depressions. The abnormalities found in a given category of vital depressive patients--cortisol hypersecretion, decreased growth hormone response to insulin hypoglycaemia and decreased luteinizing hormone secretion in menopause--are believed to be due to deficient noradrenalin-(NA)-ergic activity in the hypothalmus. Thus explained, they support the so-called MA (monoamine) hypothesis, which postulates that a functional NA deficiency in the brain plays a role in the pathogenesis of certain types of vital depression. Disorders in certain central MA-ergic systems are predictive of disorders in the hormone secretion of the anterior pituitary. Inversely, disorders in the hormone secretion of the anterior pituitary can be indicative of disorders in the MA-ergic transmission in the hypothalamus. Consequently we can expect a convergence of transmitter research and neuroendocrinological research--two lines of research which have so far been largely separated in studies of human individuals.

The effect of various hormones on cytological and biochemical properties of cultured hepatic cells were investigated in order to obtain long-term survival of the hepatocytes with adult liver functions in primary culture. Insulin supplementation of the culture medium enhanced the attachemnt efficiency of cells in primary culture without affecting either maintenance of morphological characters of epithelial cells or retention of liver-specific functions in cultured cells. A combination of dexamethasone and insulin was apparently effective in stimulating the formation of a monolayer of polygonal cells with granular cytoplasm and in maintenance of liver-specific functions for relatively longer periods. Supplementation with either dexamethasone or hydrocortisone alone enhanced tyrosine aminotransferase activities in cultured cells for at least 4 days postinoculation. These steroid hormones also allowed growth of small epithelial cells with clear cytoplasm and maintenance of increased albumin production for 8 days after inoculation. The roles of these hormones in the primary culture of isolated hepatic cells are discussed in the present paper.

A new group of substances blocking central beta receptors, ie beta blocking agents among which oxprenol and pindolol, have been used in psychiatry, mainly in anxious or depressive-anxious patients. The anxiolytic effect, particularly on somatic anxiety, is interesting, and is present in double blind studies with benzodiazepines, where it is superior to these classical agents. The author has observed this therapeutic activity in series of one hundred patients and also a dynamising effect in some of these patients. Without having observed by himself and possibly because of the low doses experimented, the author states that these drugs have an antipsychotic activity.

This work is based on the observation of memory troubles before sleep in patients with sleep problems treated with flunitrazepam. Eight subjects are tested in two sessions, flunitrazepam and placebo, in double blind, with memory tests given the evening after medication and controlled the next morning. One additional test is controlling vigilance. The results show that memory is significantly disturbed by flunitrazepam, both for direct and delayed memory, the next day. On the contrary, recognition is not altered, neither vigilance.

The resonance Raman spectra (RRS) were measured for various hemoproteins, as well as for free hemes, and analysed in terms of the interactions between the porphyrin ring and the heme iron and between the axial ligand and the heme iron. To establish vibrational assignments, the RRS of metallo-octae-thylporphyrin (M(OEP)), its 15N substituted and meso-deuterated derivatives were measured. It was found that the Raman line corresponding to the oxidation state marker of hemoproteins involves appreciable displacement of the pyrrolic nitrogen atoms toward metal ion but not that of methine bridges and that the frequencies of methine-bridge CC stretching vibrations are altered by the conjugation interaction between the porphyrin ring and the metal ion present. The prominent Raman lines of Ni(OEP) were assigned on the basis of the normal coordinate analysis. The Raman spectra of heme a bis-imidazole complex (Fe(A)(Im)2) in the presence of cyanide changed when pH was reduced to neutral. It implied formation of cyanhydrin at the peripheral formyl group of heme a. The Fe(A)(Im)2 formed an addition compound with NaHSO3 in a neutral solution but the added NaHSO3 was eliminated when the heme iron was reduced. The Raman spectra of hemoproteins were classified into four groups on the basis of the relative intensities and frequencies of the four key bands. It demonstrated the existence of two kinds of ferrous low-spin states. The difference between the two species was attributed to the difference in the nature of chemical bond between the heme iron and its sixth ligand (L). The Fe-L bonds of ferrous low-spin molecules in Groups A and C are mainly associated with the dz2(Fe)-lone pair and dz(Fe)-II(L) interactions, respectively. This interpretation of the Raman spectra appears consistent with the experimental facts that the ferrous low-spin molecules in Group C photodissociate upon illumination of light at the Soret band and also that the internal stretching frequencies of the sixth ligand are shifted to lower frequency upon coordination to the heme iron. The frequency of the oxidation state marker of reduced cytochrome P-450 (P-450cam) was unusually low in comparison with those of other hemoproteins. It was ascribed to delocalization of electrons from the thiolate anion to the porphyrin II*(ring) orbital through the pi-type molecular orbital (Eq.3). The RRS of reduced P-450cam.metyrapone adduct was quite close to that of reduced cytochrome b5. In conclusion, the Raman frequencies of hemoproteins may depend primarily upon the amount of electrons delocalized to the II* orbital of the porphyrin ring. The coordination of lone-pair electrons of the axial ligand to the iron dz2 orbital yields bond energy but scarcely affects the Raman frequencies. If the pi orbital of the axial ligand interacts with the iron dpi orbital, it perturbs the delocalization of the dpi(Fe) electrons to the II*(ring) orbital of porphyrin ring and thus affects the Raman frequencies.

220 MHz proton Fourier transform (FT) NMR with quadrature phase detection (QPD) technique is applied to observe largely hyperfine-shifted signals of various hemoproteins and hemoenzymes in ferric high-spin state. The binding of F-, OCN-, SCN-, and CH3OH to the ferric heme iron in high-spin state in various hemoproteins has been studied by the use of FT/QPD technique at 220 MHz. The binding of formate ion to metmyoglobin (metMb) has also been studied. The spectrum of the formate complex was compared with that of hemoglobin M Milwaukee where carboxylate groups are bound to the hemes of the beta subunits. The acid-base transition of ferric myoglobin (Mb) was confirmed by monitoring the pH-dependent shift of the heme side methyl signals with the reflection point at pH 9.1. This finding is analyzed on the basis of rapid exchange between alkaline (low spin) and acidic (high spin) forms accompanied by the dissociation and association of one proton in the ferric Mb. The structure of the heme environment of ferric horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was studied. The pH-dependent features of NMR spectra of the ferric enzyme and its complexes with cyanide and azide were discussed in terms of heme environmental structures, comparing with the case of metMb. The results were interpreted as follows: There exists an ionizable amino group near the heme responsible for the ligand binding reactions of the enzyme, which modulates the entry of external azide to the heme iron through protolytic equilibrium of this group. The pK value of this group was determined to be 5.9 by monitoring the pH-dependent shift of the heme peripheral methyl signals of the native enzyme, indicating that the group is probably a histidyl residue. Acid-alkaline transition of metMb was confirmed to associate with the proton dissociation of an iron-bound water molecule, whereas in HRP, pH-dependent spin state change characterized by pK 11 is attributed not to the simple protolytic reaction of the iron-bound water but to the direct coordination of an amino acid residue of the polypeptide chain to the ferric heme iron. Histidyl imidazole is a possible candidate for the new sixth iron ligand in alkaline peroxidase above pH 11. Interaction of HRP with electron donor(indolepropionic acid, IPA) was also studied. The hyperfine-shifted proton signals of the heme peripheral groups of the enzyme showed a small but significant shift with stepwise additions of IPA, indicating that the donor binds at a specific site of HRP. There results are interpreted in terms of the interaction between the enzyme and the donor at the heme edge site.

Two heme-linked groups of horseradish peroxidases, characterized by pKa = 5.8 (isoenzyme A) and 7.3 (isoenzyme C), are believed to be distal amino acid residues and, judging by their acid-base properties in various derivatives, influence the functions of these isoenzymes. In contrast, in myoglobin ionization of the distal histidine does not influence its reactivity. Accordingly, we conclude that the interaction of the distal base with a 6th ligand is weak in myoglobin but very strong in peroxidases.

Although many studies have been carried out on the cooperativityly of ligand binding to hemoglobin, its molecular mechanism is not yet completely confirmed. Various models have been proposed on one hand, but on the other hand the direct judgement of the validity of each model is confronted with experimental difficulties. With this situation in mind, we re-examine carefully various kinds of experimental data, with the intention of finding any hints for future studies on the molecular mechanism of the cooperativity of ligand binding not only to hemoglobin but also to other allosteric proteins composed of subunits. As a result of these re-examinations most of the experimental data can be consistently explained from the viewpoint that the strain due to ligation is transmitted to the interfaces of the subunits and the degree of the strain stored in the interfaces between the subunits controls the cooperativity of of ligand binding. The subjects selected to the present study are molecular structural differences between the deoxy- and oxy-hemoglobin, temperature dependence of oxygen equilibrium constants, and recombination curves of carbon monoxide in flash photolysis experiments. In the first section, the difference of the interfaces of the subunits between deoxy- and oxy-hemoglobin is investigated on the basis of the atomic coordinates determined by Perutz et al. and we examine energetically which of the segment's pairs contributes mainly to the difference in the molecular structure between the two forms. On the basis of this investigation, it is shown in the next section that the oxygen equilibrium constants of human adult hemoglobin under normal physiological conditions are well explained by the following sequence of the conformational changes. The local changes in the interfaces of the subunits are reflected directly on the small differences among the first three Adair constants and the succeeding rearrangement to the four subunits causes the outstandingly larger value of the fourth Adair constant. In more alkaline pH, this rearrangement begins to occur at the earlier stages of ligation. In the succeeding section, it is pointed out that the property of this rearrangement can be studied in more detail through the recombination curves followed by flash photolysis under special conditions.

Inoculation of HeLa and MIO cells with a guanidine-dependent mutant of poliovirus (gd-polio) in the absence of guanidine resulted in stimulation of mouse encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus reproduction. No stimulation was found to occur in the presence of actinomycin D, on pre-treatment of the cells with cordycepin, or on their UV irradiation or enucleation. In contrast to HeLa cells, the enhancement of EMC virus reproduction by gd-polio in MIO cells required no current synthesis of cellular RNAs: it occurred in the presence of actinomycin D, upon UV irradiation of the cells or their enucleation. The possible mechanisms of the stimulating effect of poliovirus in HeLa and MIO cells are discussed.

Comparative moving boundary electrophoresis revealed that influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H0N1) has a 2.5 times higher electrophoretic migration rate at pH 7 than influenza virus A/Singpore/1/57 (H2N2). This difference was the same whether the compared viruses were purified first by either ammonium sulphate precipitation or adsorption onto and elution from red blood cells and then by density gradient centrifugation. The same electrophoretic methods was used for testing the homogeneity of influenza virus preparations purified by either method.

The multiplication of 8 strains of herpes simplex virus of type 1 and 2 in normal and stimulated macrophages of NMRI and C57/bl mice was tested. Only 3 strains multiplied in normal NMRI macrophages, whereas all strains multiplied in stimulated cells. No multiplication except of one strain was observed in C57/bl macrophages. The multiplication rates of the virus strains correlated well with the determination of the acid-soluble and acid-insoluble thymidine (dTR) radioactivity and autoradiographic studies of infected (normal and stimulated) NMRI and C57/bl macrophages. The influence of the age of mice used for obtaining the macrophages was also studied. In stimulated macrophages more viral DNA was synthesised than in non-stimulated cells.

In 7 adults and 7 children with upper respiratory illness of parainfluenza aetiology, the virus was isolated in the acute phase from nasal washings or nasal smears in spite of high titres of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies in serum. By contrast, secretory HI antibodies were not demonstrated at the onset of illness in any of the patients, but their formation started early and the antibodies reached maximal levels about 10 days after onset of illness. The individual patients showed considerable differences in the dynamics of secretory antibody formation and especially in their persistence. In some of the patients, secretory antibodies were demonstrated as late as 12 months after the illness.

Monkeys and guinea pigs were immunized with various doses of measles and mumps viruses. A cell-mediated response measured by leukocyte migration inhibition occured during the first two weeks after immunization. In case of measles virus, marked migration inhibition occurred already on the 7th day in monkeys and guinea pigs immunized with high virus doses. The response declined as early as 14 days after immunization in contrast to the group of guinea pigs inoculated with a lower virus dose. In these animals the response sustained for up to 50 days. Immunization of animals with various doses of mumps virus was similar and positive responses were obtained in the absence of detectable antibodies. Even 2.5 TCID50 of mumps virus induced the response although more irregularly than 250 or 2500 TCID50 virus.

The pathogenicity of the Soph-K strain of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus produced by the persistently infected HEp-2-Soph cell culture was investigated in monkeys, white mice and hamsters. The persistent infection of this culture with TBE virus has been maintained for 17 years. The Soph-K strain was shown to retain its pathogenic properties for mice of different ages and hamsters. Morphological examinations of the brains and spinal cords of these animals infected with the Soph-K strain revealed acute and subacute forms of encephalitis. Monkeys inoculated with the Soph-K strain intracerebrally showed an asymptomatic infection with the pathomorphological picture of subacute disseminated meningoencephalitis with a progredient course for 3 months of observation. This chronic TBE infection in monkeys offers an interesting model for investigations on progressive degenerative disease of the nervous system.

In postnatally acquired lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM), specific immunofluorescent (IF) IgM antibody was found nearly in all the examined sera from 23 patients for 6-8 months after onset of the disease, IgA antibody in two-thirds of the patients and only during the first 5 weeks of the disease. In the first weeks, the titres of IF IgG and IgM antibodies reached values from 256-512 in some patients; IgA antibody titres were considerably lower. No specific IF IgM and IgA antibody was found in sera from 5 infants with prenatal LCM virus infection (3 infants with congenital hydrocephalus and chorioretinitis, 1 with cerebral palsy and chorioretinitis, and 1 with asymptomatic infection). IF IgM antibody in a titre of 4 was detected only in 2 specimens of the cerebrospinal fluid from one of the infants with hydrocephalus. It is suggested that in prenatal LCM virus infection the production of specific IgM antibody is more or less inhibited.

Inoculum with 125I added as a marker was used to determine the volume actually administered to suckling mice on intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation. In 1-2 days old animals, this volume corresponded to approximately 75% of a 20 microliter dose.

Interferon and poly I : C inhibited the growth of influenza virus in organ cultures of foetal nasal mucosa, trachea, oesophagus and adult nasal mucosa. No antiviral effect was observed in decidua organ cultures. The combined use of interferon and poly I : C resulted in the enhancement of the antiviral effect.

The electroimmunoassay (quantitative "rocket" immunoelectrophoresis) method was adopted for analysis and characterization of interferon preparations. Ammonium sulphate-precipitated anti-interferon globulin also containing unknown antibodies against antigens that contaminate interferon preparations was used in the tests. By comparing the results of the electroimmunoassay of fractions obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of human leukocyte interferon with the antiviral activity of the fractions, an excellent dissociation of molecules with interferon activity from the bulk of contaminating antigens was achieved. The method is extremely sensitive and requires very small volumes for assay.

Larvae of Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides were infected with Kaysanur Forest disease (KFD) virus by feeding on viraemic rodents and reared into next generation larvae. Fed larvae, nymphs, unfed adults, fed adult males, and females after oviposition were found infected, while the larvae were found free from infection. Nymphs and adults transmitted the infection by bite to rodents and rabbits respectively. The virus was also passed through a second rodent-tick cycle. Adult ticks showed a titre of 3.1 to 4.5 dex mouse LD50/0.03 ml, and the virus was also detected 245 days after infection.

The occurence of virus-specific antigens in explants of the Gasserian ganglia of rabbits with healed keratitis induced by the Kupka strain of human herpesvirus type 1 was tested by indirect immunofluorescence. In explants, the neurons and satellite cells revealed specific fluorescence from the 3rd day of culturing. The pattern of virus activation in the ganglion tissue was similar irrespective of whether the explants were cultured in the presence or absence of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine.

Strain LEIV-776P, possessing no haemagglutinating activity was isolated in 1971 in the Primorie region (U.S.S.R.) from Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann 1091 tick. Complement fixation (CF) tests revealed no antigenic relationship with 24 antigenic groups of arboviruses or 21 ungrouped viruses isolated from ticks. The virus isolate contains RNA and is relatively sensitive to ether and sodium deoxycholate; it is pathogenic for suckling mice and two-week-old white mice by the intracerebral route, and replicates in primary cultures of chick and duck fibroblasts and green monkey kidneys and in a continuous line of pig embryo kidney cells without any cytopathic effect. According to electron microscopy, its size is 90-110 nm. Its morphological properties permit to classify it as a member of the family Bunyaviridae.

The foetal pH (the term 'foetal pH' is used for the pH of foetal capillary blood obtained by making a small incision in the foetal scalp or buttocks) and the umbilical cord blood glucose levels in pregnant women with foetal distress were estimated in 19 babies as a prospective study in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The Apgar Scores on delivery were also estimated. There was a significant correlation coefficient between foetal pH and Apgar Score r = 0.38 and the coefficient of correlation between umbilical artery blood glucose and foetal pH was 0.08. Estimation of the pH of blood taken from the foetal scalp is now well established as a diagnostic measure in the early diagnosis of foetal distress due to hypoxia. The results obtained from this small series of nineteen patients highlights the importance of the estimation of foetal pH, blood glucose and the Apgar Score. This is the first account in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.

Clinical impressions, reinforced by reports in both professional journals and the lay press, suggested that use and abuse of minor tranquilizers and sedative-hypnotics was extensive among patients in our drug treatment clinics and required some change in our policies. We surveyed a randomly selected national sample of methadone program physicians and found they shared our assumptions concerning the use of these drugs. A pilot program of urine screening for the presence of adjunctive drugs was completed, and we found the incidence of use to be below expected levels, except for opiates and alcohol. These results suggest we should reconsider plans to alter clinic policies concerning the regulation of these substances. A rigorous examination of serum and/or urine in a national research program to determine both the incidence of adjunctive drug use by clients in drug treatment programs and correlations of such data with national surveys would be an expensive undertaking, but would provide a more rational basis for policy making at both local and national levels.

Using a fluorometric assay for the determination of oxidized pyridine nucleotides (NAD[P]+), total and cyanide-resistant NADPH-oxidative activities have been measured in subcellular fractions isolated from resting and phagocytosing human polymorphonuclears. Enzymatic activies responsible for the oxidation of the NADPH have been recovered in the heavy particles (15,000g/15 min), the low-density particles (100,000g/30 min), and the cytosolic fraction. Stimulation of the cells with opsonized zymosan had a different effect on the NADPH-oxidative activities of these subcellular fractions, which suggests the involvement of various types of enzymatic systems in the oxidation of NADPH. The cytosolic fraction interacted strongly with the enzymatic activities occurring in the sedimentable fractions and is therefore thought to play a central role in the regulation of the activation of the oxidative metabolism associated with phagocytosis.

Exposure of the distal esophageal mucosa to acid gastric juice was quantitated by 24-hr pH monitoring in 100 individuals and was correlated with morphologic data derived from esophageal biopsies. The degree of acid exposure to the distal esophagus correlated directly with increases in both relative and absolute length of the subepithelial papillae and to relative basal zone hyperplasia. Both papillary length and basal zone hyperplasia decreased after antireflux surgery had reduced acid exposure to normal. Reflux in the recumbent position resulted in prolonged exposure of the mucosa to acid because of poor acid clearing from the esophagus. This caused longer papillae than did upright reflux, where there were more frequent reflux episodes, but with rapid acid clearance. The presence of a hiatal hernia was associated with longer papillae, lower DES pressure, increased reflux frequency, and prolonged recumbent acid clearance. Twenty-four hour pH monitoring correlated better with papillary length than did symptoms or other clinical measures of gastroesophageal reflux.

Multiple deficiency disorder fibroblasts cultured in MEM-CO2 showed deficiencies of arylsulfatase A(ARS A) comparable to the deficiency in metachromatic leukodystrophy fibroblasts. However, the MSDD fibroblasts cultured in MEM-HEPES contained near normal levels of ARS A. Moreover, the enzyme from the latter fibroblasts was indistinguishable from ARS A of control fibroblasts on DEAE-cellulose chromatography, ratio of activity with several substrates, thermal inactivation, sensitivity to inhibitors, and precipitation by antiserum to human ARS A. These data support the conclusion that the ARS A genome is intact in MSDD fibroblasts and, by extension, in MSDD patients. Other sulfatases were present at levels ranging from mildly deficient to near normal but never as low as seen in the corresponding specific sulfatase deficient disorders.

The renal response of the fetal lamb to repeated complete occlusion of the umbilical cord was studied in nine chronically instrumented animals. Five episodes of occlusion of the umbilical cord, each lasting for two minutes, produced a twofold rise in fetal urine osmolality and sodium, chloride, and potassium concentrations. Output of urine and glomerular filtration rate remained essentially unchanged while free water clearance decreased from a control of +0.10 to -0.02 ml. per kilogram per minute at the end of the fifth episode. Electrolyte concentrations in urine remained elevated for at least two hours following the occlusions. In addition to changes in urine composition, there was a 50- to 200-fold increase in the fetal plasma concentration of vasopressin. These studies indicate that complete interruption of the umbilical circulation, even though of short duration, produces disturbances in fetal renal function that can lead to loss of electrolytes in the urine. They provide an explanation for the low sodium levels reported in asphyxiated newborn infants in renal failure.

The short circuit current as a function of Na concentration in both solutions was found to obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics under a variety of experimental conditions. Values of maximal transport rate (Im) and half-maximal Na concentrations (Kt) were determined from these experiments. Three type of results were obtained: 1) Im and Kt both decreased by approximately the same fraction when the pH of both solutions was reduced by increasing PCO2, 2) Im decreased and Kt increased when the external pH was decreased, and 3) Im increased with ADH and theophylline, decreased with external Ca, and Kt remained unchanged. Various criteria were utilized to determine that these were properties of the entry barrier for Na into the "transport pool." The results are explained in terms of a model that separates three different types of actions on the entry barrier: 1) competition of Na with other ions in the external solution for entry, 2) modulation of the number of sites available for Na translocation by changing the cytoplasmic pH, and 3) alterations in the rate of Na translocation caused by changes in the Na permeability or the electrochemical gradient across the entry barrier.

Changes of the intracellular pH of rat diaphragm muscle were monitored at 30-min intervals with the weak acid DMO (5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione). Transferring the muscle from a CO2-containing to a CO2-free solution caused intracellular pH (pHi) to rise by an average of 0.18 during the first 30 min and then to level off at a slightly lower value over the next 60-90 min. Transferring the muscle from a CO2-free to a CO2-containing solution caused pHi to fall by 0.18 during the first 30 min and then to recover by 0.05 over the next 90 min. Subsequent return to the CO2-free solution caused pHi to overshoot the control value by 0.10. Both the recovery and the overshoot can be accounted for by an acid-extruding pump. Intracellular acid loading with 118 mM DMO similarly caused pHi to fall initially, to recover slowly during the acid loading, and then to overshoot the control pHi on removal of the acid load. In the absence of HCO3-/CO2, acid extrusion was reduced by about a fifth. SITS (4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid) had no effect. The absence of either Na+ or Cl- from HCO3-/CO2- free solution reduced acid extrusion by about a half.

Infection rates ranged from 0-2.1% in adults of Aedes triseriaus reared from groups of larvae that had ingested La Crosse (LAC) virus (Clifornia encephalitis group) at dosages of 7.0-8.3 log 10 SMICLD50/ml. Females form orally infected larvae transmitted the virus to suckling mice. Larvae that devoured carcasses of transovarially infected larvae containing 3.0 log 10 SMICLD 50/ml failed to become infected. Ingestion by larvae of infected carcasses appears, therefore, to be unimportant as a method of horizontal amplification of LAC virus.

150 patients undergoing minor gynaecological procedures (curretages) were anesthetized with ketamine and either diazepam flunitrazepam or placebo in order to establish the best combination for the prevention of postoperative psychotomimetic effects. From observations, up to 24 h after operation, it was found and statistically proven that the combination of ketamine/flunitrazepam as compared to the combinations ketamine/diazepam and ketamine/placebo led to a remarkable reduction of psychotomimetic side reactions.

Naloxone was used in 20 patients divided into two series: series A consisted of 10 adults with an average age of 50.6 years (+/- 12.03) and series B 10 children with an average age of 8.5 years (+/- 5.16). Naloxone was given in the treatment of postoperative respiratory depression related to persistence of morphine impregnation, the patients having received either fentanyl (mean dose 0.04 mg/kg/h) or dextromoramide (mean dose 1.15 mg/kg/h). The mean dose of naloxone was 0.26 mg +/- 0.10, i.e. 3.9 microgram/kg in series A, and 0.13 mg +/- 0.11, i.e. 5.3 microgram/kg in series B. In both series, study of ventilatory function showed correction and stabilisation of the various parameters (F/min, Vt and V) up to 180 minutes after the injection. Recovery was rapid in both groups (7 to 10 min) and of good quality. Whilst it was accompanied in a number of cases by the recurrence of pain, the latter never required specific relief. The administration of naloxone was associated with an increase in heart rate (non-significant) at 10 min in series A and 30 min in series B. Apart an episode of nausea in one case of series A, no disagreeable side effects were observed.

The object of this study was the use of naloxone to correct hypoventilation related to the use of morphinomimetics without suppressing the analgesic effect of these agents. The study involved ten patients undergoing gynaecological surgery under neuroleptanalgesia and who at the end of surgery had hypoventilation due to the use of fentanyl (average dose : 4.87 microgram/kg/h) or phenoperidine (average dose : 48.7 microgram/kg/h). Naloxone was administered intravenously in an average dose of 1.37 microgram/kg (in one or two injections) followed by an intramuscular injection of an average of 0.73 microgram/kg. Under these conditions, respiratory depression was completely corrected in all cases, the effect being durable. Good analgesia was retained and there was a normal return to consciousness without undesirable effects.

Recordings were electroencephalographical (EEG with spectral analysis), polygraphical (EMG, EKG, breathing). Visual and Auditory Cerebral Evoked Responses were also recorded. The depth of narcosis was quantified upon EEG data. The reactivity during the narcosis and the mechanisms of action of Etomidate on the "non specific structures" are discussed. Cautions should be taken with the use of tomidate in anesthesiology with epileptic and arteriopathic patients.

The effects of Etomidate on cerebral blood flow (C.B.F.) and cerebral oxygen consumption (C.02 C.) were studied in 13 patients in a neuroradiology department. Induction of anaesthesia was ensured using a standard dose of 15 mg of Etomidate, followed by a constant rate infusion (2.8 mg/kg/hour). Seven subjects were considered to be normal whilst six were suffering from tumour pathology. Under the influence of Etomidate, C.B.F. in the normal subjects decreased by 34 p. 100 and C.02 C. by 46.7 p. 100. The relationship between C.B.F. and arterial PC01 was studied under the influence of Etomidate: cerebral vasoactivity to C02 was maintained. A special study was made of focal changes in flow in patients with tumour pathology. Under the influence of Etomidate, there were zones of adaptation of flow, indicative of vasoparalysis situated opposite the tumour.

A study of the haemodynamic effects of an injection of 0.3 mg/kg of Etomidate was carried out in 11 multiple trauma patients under constant controlled ventilation. At the 3 rd minute after injection there was a slight, but significant, increase in cardiac output and in the systolic index of the left ventricle, persisting at the 20th minute. It may be concluded that the injection of a dose of 0.3 mg/kg has no harmful haemodynamic effects in this type of patient.

In 35 orthopaedic surgery patients (33 adults and 2 children), anaesthesia was obtained using an association of etomidate and fentanyl. Induction was obtained by injection from a syringe of a mixture of etomidate and fentanyl in an average dose of 21 mg for etomidate and 0,08 mg for fentanyl. Anaesthesia was maintained by constant dose of etomidate was 1.29 mg/kg/h and 4.96 microgram/kg/h for fentanyl. The mixture used for both induction and maintenance contained 1.3 mg of etomidate and 5 mg of fentanyl per ml. The results, value, indications and contraindications of this technique are described.

A local anaesthetic may be selected from amongst the two major groups of drugs of this type: amino-alcoyl-esters and amino-acylamides. In practice, three substances are available or will shortly be available in France: lignocaine, etidocaine and bupivacaine, thus limiting the choice. This choice is guided by the toxicity of the substance, its clinical effects and 1st side effects. 1-Toxicity depends upon the nature of the substance, the dose necessary to obtain analgesia and to prolong it for a sufficient time. 2-Amongst the clinical effects which should be noted in the choice of a local anaesthetic are the latent period before analgesia is obtained, the degree of sensory block, the degree of motor block and the duration of action. The three substances available are compared in relations to these parameters and in the light of the specific requirements of obstetric analgesia. The value of the addiction of adrenalin is discussed. 3-The side effects are those of the local anesthetic itself and of its possible association with adrenalin. On the basis of the various criteria mentioned, it would seem that the analgesic of choice for obstetric analgesia is bupivacaine used with or without adrenalin.

A review of the effects during labour of epidural analgesia on dilatation, expulsion and delivery of the placenta. Uncertainties in knowledge of the precise organisation of uterine innervation and of the intrinsic innervation of the organ render the study of changes in uterine contraction and in cervical resistances difficult. At circulating levels higher than those found in clinical practice, local anaesthetics have a definite oxytocic e-fect, local anaesthetics have a definite oxytoci effect, whilst adrenalin is a powerfult tocolytic. By contrast, the indirect effects related to neurolysis in extradural analgesia are negligeable. Cervico-segmentary resistances are decreased. In practice, there is no increase in the period of dilatation in the absence of any haemodynamic disturbances and if mixtures containing adrenalin are avoided. Expulsion is favourised by muscular relaxation but impaired by the lack of voluntary expulsive effort, hence the choice of a local anaesthetic with the lowest possible motor effect. Delivery of the placenta, which involves only uterine contraction, which is not affected, may be accelerated by oxytocics.

Bupivacaine (Marcaine) is being used increasingly in obstetrics for epidural analgesia, by virtue of the good sensory block obtained and the minimum of side-effects on the mother and newborn infant. At a concentration of less than 0.5 p. 100, analgesia is excellent with a minimal effect on motor fibres. Side-effects and toxicity are limited by the use of fractionated doses from the beginning of labour or of a single dose during or at the end of labour calculated in relation to the effect sought. Any action on the newborn infant would appear to be exceptional, if dose recommendations are respected, the high percentage of Marcaine bound to proteins limiting its transplacental passage.

A prospective study was undertaken at Strasbourg of the assessment of the patients of the techniques used by the obstetric team and of the general atmosphere in which labour and delivery took place. A questionnair of 115 items was analysed by computer using a Pastis-Pascal programme (see attached). The first results, concerning the analysis of 100 cases and taking into account approximately ten variables, gave the following findings: -the intolerable pain factor is related to the period of dilatation; -the analgesic or amnesic factor in the mother influences the satisfaction she experiences in relation to her child; -demand for epidural anaesthesia appeared the same, whether the woman had been prepared by a psychoprophylactic method or not; -psychoprophylactic preparation would not appear to influence the assessment of pain; -women having an epidural anaesthetic never considered their labour to have been intolerable. Discriminant analysis with study of correlations is not possible at present. Given the number of variables to be considered, the population analysed is inadequate. A multicentre study would improve the performance of this research. Our questionnaire is available to any teams who might wish to use it.

In order that continous epidural anaesthesia may be given safely in an obstetric centre, the permanent presence of an anaesthetist is necessary. Obstetricians and midwives must be familiar with the management of labour using this method and team spirit involving continous cooperation between the anaesthetist, obstetrician and midwives is essential. Training related to epidural anaesthesia is necessary  for the members of the obsteric centre, as well as education of the patients.

It is impossible not to note the small number of epidural anaesthetics given for obstetrics in France. The rarity of centres where it is offered by a team of specially trained anaesthetists and obstetricians contrasts with the increase in demand from the patients themselves. Study of the number of epidural anaesthetics predictable in obstetrics according to the criteria of indication indicates that the procedure could be used in as many as 30 to 50 per cent of deliveries. This implies a need for an increase in the number of anaesthetists, i.e. an increase not so much in the total number as in those trained in obstetrics with experience of epidural anaesthesia. Similar changes are necessary in hospital organisation, in such a way that the place of the anaesthetist in the maternity unit is recognised officially, this recognition being strengthened by routine out-patient consultation with all patients during their pregnancy. The economic aspect of a possible increase in the number of epidural anaesthetics carried out in France and in the number of anaesthetists performing the procedure is envisaged in terms of salaries in the public hospital system, costing of the procedure by the Social Security and the true cost of epidural anaesthesia.

2620 is a respiratory analeptic which acts by stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors. It was administered intravenously in 22 patients in acute respiratory insufficiency. Doses during the first hour varied between 0.7 and 3 mg/kg. A careful study of the effects on respiration showed a significant increase in minute ventilation without any proportional increase in frequency for doses of between 1.7 and 3 mg/kg. Continuous recording of the electroencephalogram over a period of one hour revealed no convulsant effect even in particularly vulnerable patients. In seven patients, tracings showed a change in the sense of increased consciousness which corresponded with the clinical course of the diseases responsible for the state of hypoventilation.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the prior injection of betamethasone was capable of preventing blood pressure changes and the fall in arterial pO2 when following the fixation of total hip protheses with methyl metacrylate. It involved 54 patients in whom systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure (BP), arterial pO2, pCO2 and heart rate were noted at different times: T1, 15 minutes after the beginning of the operation; T2 and T3, one minute and five minutes after application of the cement; T4, at the end of the operation. There was no significant difference between the various measurements at times T1, T2, and T3 as far as blood pressure and heart rate were concerned. By contrast, there was a fall in pO2 at times T2 and T2 in relation to times T1 and T4. This fall was significant (p is less than 0.01) but never theless remained moderate. The possible influence of betamethasone is discussed.

A comparative study of the venous contamination (Qs/Qt = (Cc'O2 - CaO2) / (Cc'O2 - C-vO2) under FIO2 = 0.45 - 0.6 and under FIO2 = 1, was realised in 9 patients with lesions of pulmonary oedema. Increasing the FIO2 lead to an increase in the venous contamination three times (average increase was 36 p. 100 of the initial value), to no change two times and a decrease four times (average decrease of 34 p. 100). The values of the venous contamination under average FIO2 are statistically lower in the group where it rises on increasing the FIO2 than in that in which it falls or remains unchanged (p is less than 0.005).

Laboratory tests are increasingly important in the surveillance of drug treatments. People in charge of clinical laboratory science must now become aware of a new development, the use of as indicators of the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, especially of the induction of such enzymes. Ideally, the activity of such enzymes should be measured in the tissues. In man, however, easier indirect methods of application are now most often used : measurement of antipyrine half-life, urinary and plasma drug metabolites, protein and specific enzyme levels in palsma, changes in endogenous substrates and endogenous metabolites, and enzymes in circulating blood cells. Of all these, two examinations are now widely performed, those for urinary glucaric acid and gamma-glutamyltrasferase. The value and limitations of these two tests are discussed.

Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT, EC 2.3.2.2) is in man and animals mainly a renal enzyme. It is also present in non-negligeable quantities in the liver except in certain rodents such as the rat. In the cells, the cytosoluble fraction of the enzyme is very low and most of the enzyme is linked to the microsomal fraction in vitro. This fraction permits its use in the diagnosis of liver and biliary disease by measurement of its serum activity and that of renal disease by measurement of its urinary activity. In biological research, the prospects offered by GGT both in human and animal cancers, and in pharmacology and toxicology makes it probably one of the most appreciated biological tests in the exploration of liver, biliary and renal function.

Half automated method for determining a L-leucinamide splitting enzymatic activity in human sera. In normal and pathological human sera, two distinct L-leucinamide splitting enzymatic activities have been demonstrated. One of them has an optimal activity at pH 9 (alcaline leucine amidase activity) and shows the most properties of a classic leucinaminopeptidase (E.C. 3.4.11.1). The other (neutral leucine amidase activity) has an optimal activity at pH : 7,5--7,8 and is not activated by Mg2+ ions. In the present work a semi-automated method permitting the determination of the "neutral leucine amidase activity" is presented. The mean of the reference values for normal human sera are established to 31,54 mUI/ml, and the upper normal limit is 48 mUI/ml. The neutral leucine amidase activity is studied in pathological sera comparatively with two other aminopeptidase activities : "alcaline leucine amidase activity", and "leucine-arylamidase". Our study shows that in pathological sera, the neutral leucine amidase activity" varies often without any correlation with those parameters.

We undertook a literature review to document whether certain therapeutic measures could be considered safe during pregnancy in the allergic patient. With the possible exception of brompheniramine, the commonly used antihistamine drugs appear to be safe during pregnancy. The bronchodilators ephedrine and theophylline also appear to be safe, as does cromolyn. Corticosteroids do not appear to have adverse effects in pregnancy beyond those well recognized in nonpregnant patients. Because side effects are reduced when steroids are administered as aerosols in the nose or lung, these preparations seem well suited for use in pregnancy. The safety of allergic immunotherapy has been confirmed. For asthma, annual influenza vaccination is indicated.

The third reported case of bilateral central retinal artery occlusion associated with polyarteritis nodosa is presented. An alternative etiology of the frequently observed association of polyarteritis nodosa with optic atrophy is suggested. A plan of therapy is recommended.

Some beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are exciting new ocular hypotensive compounds. Unlike pilocarpine, the mainstay of glaucoma treatment for the last 100 years, beta-blocking agents do not contract the pupil nor interfere with vision even in patients with central lens opacities. They also do not cause spasm of the ciliary muscle producing transient myopia and disturbance of accommodation. Paradoxically, one of these agents, timolol, causes a fall in intraocular pressure when administered locally even in patients responding to beta-agonists with a reduction in intraocular pressure. Concomitant administration of timolol with epinephrine seems to enhance its ocular hypotensive effect in many patients. The exact mode of action of beta-blockers in reducing intraocular pressure is unknown but appears to primarily reduce aqueous production. This new class of drugs seems destined to play an important role in the treatment as well as in the understanding of glaucoma.

Over a period of three years 829 cases of greater than or equal to 16-year-old athlete exertion injuries and syndromes were collected. There were 75 women and 754 men in the series. About 90% of the athletes had been training regularly for more than two years, and 75% of them trained 6 times a week or more. Approximately 52% of the injuries occurred in track and field athletics, about 17% in ball events, 13.6% in skiing, 7.4% in orienteering, and 4.7% in power events. Other sports were associated with fewer exertion injuries. 28.7% of the conditions occurred in the knee, 17% in the ankle, foot and heel, 14.8% in the leg, 8.2% in the back and trunk, 8.1% in the thigh, 7.4% in the achilles tendon. The rest were in the shoulder, neck and upper extremities. In 92% of the patients conservative treatment and rest were used. Only 8% of the cases were treated surgically.

The development of a sensitive method for the localisation of gamma-glutamyl transferase isoenzymes after electrophoresis on various media is described. Recommendations on final conditions are given for optimal concentrations of substrate, acceptor and buffer, and for pH of the reaction mixture. The reaction conditions are compared with other isoenzyme localisation techniques previously reported.

Gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) activity was measured in serum and urine before and after extraction with n-butanol. Residual gamma-GT activity after extraction of normal serum with butanol was more than 75%, whereas for normal urine the figure was less than 68%. The loss of activity from urine was not affected by prior dialysis, and the stabilisation which resulted from adding bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 40 g/l did not approach the residual activity with normal serum. In patients with a variety of renal diseases, residual gamma-GT activity in the urine after butanol extraction was inversely correlated with the creatinine clearance. Butanol extraction was performed on serum samples from 182 patients with a variety of diseases. Eighty-one per cent of patients with elevated gamma-GT activities caused by hepatobiliary disease had an increased loss of activity after butanol extraction. By contrast, only 34% of patients with increases gamma-GT activities in whom there was no clinical or other biochemical evidence of hepatic disease, had increased loss of gamma-GT activity after butanol. The reasons for differences between urinary and serum gamma-GT in response to butanol, and the implications in interpreting serum gamma-GT activities are discussed.

Differences in alkaline phosphatase activity of some commerical control sera were observed when comparing manual with AutoAnalyzer versions of the Kind and King procedure. This phenomenon was found to be associated with sera boosted with exogenous alkaline phosphatase and to be owing mainly to inadequate provision of buffer in some automated methods. It is suggested that a modification to the SMA procedure may lessen the problem, but the constraints of the system necessitate a compromise. There was better precision after the modification had been introduced. Awareness of this phenomenon is of paramount importance if commerical sera are to be used in any way in the calibration of automated systems for alkaline phosphatase assay.

pH, Pco2, and Po2 measurements have been made over a three-week period on General Diagnostics Blood GAS Control Ampoules and on a tonometered buffer system. The latter seems adequate as a precision and accuracy control of pH, Pco2, and Po2 measurements in a single solution. The former seems adequate as a precision control of these measurements, but, on the particular batch provided, mean values need to be determined within the customer's laboratory.

The antihypertensive effects on metoprolol and pindolol were compared in 50 patients with essential hypertension belonging to WHO stage 1 or 2. After four weeks of placebo treatment the patients were randomly allocated to treatment with metoprolol or pindolol. During the initial dose-titration period of six weeks the dose was individually adjusted, aiming at a diastolic blood pressure in the seated position less than 95 mm Hg. The maximum possible dosage for metoprolol was 50, 100 and 150 mg b.i.d. and for pindolol 5, 10 and 15 mg b.i.d. Thereafter followed a fixed-dose period of 20 weeks. Six patients did not complete the study. At the end of the study satisfactory blood pressure control, defined as a diastolic blood pressure in the seated position less than 95 mm Hg, was achieved in 15 of the 20 patients (75%) in the metroprolol group and in 13 out of 24 patients (54%) in the pindolol group. The average reduction in diastolic blood pressure was more pronounced with metoprolol than with pindolol, while no difference was found between the two beta-blockers with regard to the reduction of the systolic blood pressure. Generally, metoprolol and pindolol were both well tolerated by the patients.

The antihypertensive effect of a new non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking compound, penbutolol (40 mg b.i.d.), was compared with propranolol (160 mg b.i.d.) in a series of 20 hypertensive patients using a double-blind cross-over scheme. Both compounds reduced both the supine and the standing blood pressure significantly. The magnitude of the responses did not differ significantly and both compounds evoked a commensurate decrease in heart rate. No significant side-effects were noted and a series of laboratory tests did not disclose any biochemical changes.

The effect of beta-blockade by acebutolol on global and regional myocardial perfusion (133Xenon wash-out) was studied in 10 patients with coronary artery disease. Another group of 10 similar patients was used to study the effect of acebutolol on left ventricular cavity size (metal markers--spot film camera). Global perfusion responses roughly paralleled the changes in rate-pressure variable which decreased in 8 patients and increased in 2 who had spontaneous angina pectoris. Regional perfusion decreased more in areas distal to less than 75% stenoses than in those distal to less than 75% stenoses (29 vs 12%; p = 0.10 less than 0.20). Left ventricular asynergy did not modify the response, nor did the presence or absence of collateral vessels. No evidence was found to support the thesis that beta-blockade may evoke a redistribution in perfusion which favours the potentially ischaemic areas of myocardium. Left ventricular cavity size remained unchanged after acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-blocking compound with some degree of agonist activity.

Tissue residues from 3 SSPE brains extracted at neutral pH were thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline and further extracted at acidic pH. The low-pH extracts had significant measles antibody titers, and their measles-specific IgG content ranged from 40 to 60% of total IgG. Agarose-gel electrophoretic analysis of the extracts showed oligoclonal IgG bands, most of which disappeared after suitable absorption with measles virus, demonstrating the presence of restricted measles antibody population. Ouchterlony analysis showed a reaction of identity between bound IgG and IgG extracted at neutral pH. Thus IgG extracted at low and neutral pHs is remarkably similar.

During an investigation of microorganisms utilizing petrochemicals, a strain identified as Flavobacterium rigense was found to accumulate a new amino acid in a medium containing 1,2-propanediol as the sole carbon source. Cultural conditions for the accumulation of the product were investigated, and as a result, the yield was increased to 2.8 mg/ml after a 5-day incubation in a medium containing 8% 1,2-propanediol. The pure amino acid was isolated, and its structure was investigated. Elemental analysis and infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectral analyses indicated that the amino acids is O-2-hydroxypropylhomoserine.

The aggregation of poliovirus and reovirus was followed in buffers at various pH values by means of a single particle analysis (SPA) test. The SPA test used here was modified from the original test reported earlier to prevent disaggregation of virus clumps from invalidating the results. The modified SPA test demonstrated that the efficiency of aggregation, which is a measure of the percentage of collisions which are effective in producing an aggregate, may vary widely depending on the conditions in which the virus is placed. The modified SPA test was also used to demonstrate that the kinetic features of viral aggregation follow the classical laws of colloid particle aggregation, which in turn are solely dependent upon diffusion of the particles as caused by brownian motion.

As a first step toward the understanding of virus particle interactions in water, we have used the modified single particle analysis test to follow the aggregation of poliovirus and reovirus as induced by low pH in suspensions containing varying amounts of dissolved salts. Salts composed of mono-, di-, and trivalent cations and mono- and divalent anions were tested for their ability to reduce or increase the aggregation of these viruses in relation to that obtained by low pH alone. Mono- and divalent cations in concentrations covering those in natural waters were generally found to cause a decrease in aggregation, with the divalent cations having a much greater effectiveness than the monovalent cations. Trivalent ions (Al3+), in micromolar concentrations, were found to cause aggregation over that at low pH alone. Anions, whether monovalent or divalent, had little ability to produce inhibition of viral aggregation, and thus the overall effects were due almost exclusively to the cation. This was true regardless of whether the overall charge on the virus particle was positive or negative, as determined by the relation between the isoelectric point and the pH at which the tests were carried out. Thus, whereas virus particles conform to classical colloid theory in many respects, there are specific exceptions which must be taken into account in the design of any experiment in which viral aggregation is a factor.

A method is described for the quantitative and, possibly, large-scale extraction of astaxanthin from the yeast Phaffia rhodozyma. The method utilizes extracellular enzymes produced by the bacterium Bacillus circulans WL-12, which partially digests the yeast cell wall and renders the carotenoid pigments extractable by acetone or ethanol. Complete recovery of astaxanthin from heat-killed P. rhodozyma cells was obtained after growing B. circulans WL-12 on these yeast cells for 26 h and then extracting the yeast-bacterium mixture with acetone. A bacteria-free lytic system, which gave quantitative extraction of astaxanthin from P. rhodozyma, was obtained by concentrating the culture broth from the growth of B. circulans WL-12 on P. rhodozyma cells. Hydrolytic enzyme activities detected in this concentrate included beta-(1 leads to 3)-glucanase, beta-(1 leads to 6)-glucanase, alpha-(1 leads to 3)-glucanase, xylanase, and chitinase. The lytic system was found to work most efficiently at pH 6.5 and with low concentrations of yeast.

Thiobacillus ferrooxidans is an acidophilic organism important to metal leaching of low-grade ores. The aforementioned importance is related to the ability of the bacterium to oxidize reduced iron and sulfur, principally found in nature as pyrite (FeS2). The present study dealt with sulfide oxidation at low pH values and the involvement of the cell envelope in the process of the inorganic oxidations. Sulfide oxidation was noted in spheroplasts of T. ferrooxidans prepared by enzymatic and chemical treatments and partially purified by differential centrifugation. No enzyme activities were noted in membrane fractions containing enrichments of lipopolysaccharide symbolic of outer membrane material or in membrane vesicles containing (or associated with) higher levels of proteins. Results to date indicate that in an acid milieu the envelope structure containing both the outer membrane and the intact inner cytoplasmic membrane is required for sulfide oxidation.

A medium containing L-sorbose and sodium deoxycholate was devised which induces colonial growth of Phanaerochaete chrysosporium in the presence of a variety of supplements. The restricted size and heavy conidial production of the colonies permits high plating densities and the use of a replica-plating technique for copying the pattern of colony growth.

Oxatomide or R 35443, 1-(3-[4-(diphenylmethyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl)-1,3-dihydro--2H-benzimidazol-2-one, a compound with potent antihistaminic and anti-anaphylactic activities, shows specific antiserotonin effects on isolated caudal arteries of the rat. In vivo it is a powerful antagonist of bronchospasm induced by serotonin and by histamine; it has no anticholinergic effects and does not affect blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. These antiserotonin properties of oxatomide may contribute significantly to its anti-allergic activity.

Rats were trained to discriminate drug vs. no-drug in a shock-escape T-maze task; a right turn was required when rats were drugged and a left turn when undrugged. The three antihistamine drugs pyrilamine, dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl) were discriminated after an average of 20 training sessions indicating that their effects were only moderately discriminable. After criterion performance was achieved under the training conditions, substitution tests were conducted during which rats received a novel drug and were then run in the maze with both goals accessible. Rats trained with antihistamine drugs made drug choices during tests with other antihistamines. Rats trained with other types of drugs made no-drug choices during tests with antihistamines. The results suggest that the antihistamines share a discriminable effect which is relatively unique to that class of drugs.

Two dose levels of clobazam, a benzodiazepine derivative, were compared to placebo for their effects upon psychomotor performance in an acute dose daytime study with normals. An acute dose of 10 mg clobazam significantly reduced response latencies in the low reinforcement condition of a psychomotor performance task but not in the high reinforcement condition. However 20 mg clobazam did not produce any significant changes in performance under either low or high reinforcement. Response speed changes generally correlated positively with trait anziety and neuroticism scores at both doses of clobazam.

Isoproterenol (10(-5) and 10(-4)M) inhibited a low affinity but not a high affinity form of rat heart cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. The concentrations of isoproterenol required to produce inhibition of the isolated enzyme were 10,000 to 100,000 fold larger than those required to produce a positive chronotropic response in the isolated atria. Another beta adrenergic receptor agonist, soterenol, had no effect on any of the isolated forms of the enzyme. Theophylline produced inhibition of low and high affinity forms of phosphodiesterase at the same concentrations required to produce a positive chronotropic response in the isolated atria. Results from two experimental models failed to reveal any circumstances under which a contribution to the positive chronotropic response could result from isoproterenol-induced inhibition of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase.

In a series of experiments, it is demonstrated that the trace element vanadium (4.10(-7) g-at/1 as NH4VO3) has a considerable positive influence on the synthesis of delta-aminolevulinic acid(delta-ALA) in the autotrophically growing green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa, the effect being visible by an enhanced output of the amino acid into the culture medium in presence of levulinic acid (LA). The level of intracellularly accumulated delta-ALA, however, is not changed in presence of the metal. The V-effect on exogenous found delta-ALA is suppressed, when LA is added to the nutrient medium at low pH (pH5), although V-uptake into the algal cells is not disturbed by LA. As demonstrated in culture media with various nitrogen sources (urea, partially hydrolized urea, ammonium salts), the development of the pH during the cultivation time is important for the presentation of the V-effect on delta-ALA. It is suggested that vanadium acts as a catalyst in the conversion of 4,5-dioxovaleric acid to delta-ALA by transamination.

Endocrine evaluation with LH-RH (0.1 mg/m2) and chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG 3 X 1,500 I.U.) in 154 cryptorchid boys aged 1 month to 15 years showed a decrease of LH pituitary secretion and Leydig-cells response to HCG in prepubertal and early pubertal patients. These deficiencies were positively correlated. Partial and at least transient descent of cryptorchid testis or testes has been obtained in 87 of 265 patients treated with HCG (3 to 9 X 1,500 I.U.). Plasma testosterone after HCG 3 X 1,500 I.U. was less increased in patients whose cryptorchid testis or testes descended after 9 X 1,500 I.U. than in those whose testes remained undescended. These data suggest that a partial, early and transient deficiency of pituitary LH secretion may be responsible for testicular maldescent in part of cryptorchid boys.

The overall objective of this 18-month open study was to compare standard neuroleptics and long-acting depot neuroleptics following the current psychiatric practice in order to determine the best therapy. Thirty French psychiatrists from 15 different wards participated in this experiment. One hundred eighty-one chronic schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following three treatments: standard neuroleptics, pipotiazine palmitate, or fluphenazine decanoate. Criteria used for evaluation were an overall clinical evaluation by a psychiatrist, a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and a Nurse's Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation. No significant difference (P greater than .05) was observed between the three groups in drug effectiveness or tolerance.

In a study of vestibular responses to caloric stimulation that controlled opportunity for fixation and state of alertness, we evaluated previous findings of diminished nystagmus in schizophrenia. We failed to replicate earlier reports in these respects: (1) None of the psychotic patient groups, when compared with normal controls, showed lower response intensity, latency, or culmination time of the nystagmic response. (2) The schizophrenic groups did not manifest a prevalence of clinically significant asymmetry. We did, however, observe that chronic deteriorated schizophrenics and recent schizophrenics have significantly greater dysrhythmic responses. This diminished orderliness of nystagmus may explain previous reports of absent or diminished nystagmus in the schizophrenics. The results are not compatible with peripheral vestibular disease in schizophrenia, but they may reflect state-related phenomena consistent with disturbances in alertness, which are not necessarily voluntary or motivational in origin.

Continuing our contributions on proteases of human placenta we enriched some unidentified neutral peptidases by chromatographying freeze dried placenta extracts on CM-Sephadex, followed by preparative isoelectric focusing and chromatography on Ultrogel. By this procedure two Acetyl-aminoacyl-p-nitranilidases, three Ala-Ala-p-nitranilidases, one Benzyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Ala-p-nitranilidase, one Carbobenzoxy-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitranilidase and one PZ-peptidase could be characterized in greater detail. Here molecular weights, isoelectric points and pH-optima of these enzymes are reported.

Paraneurons are those cells which have not been designated as neurons but are recognized as closely related to neurons on the basis of their fine structure (possession of neurosecretion-like and synaptic vesicle-like granules/vacuoles), metabolism (production of neurosecretion- and neurotransmitter-like substances) and origin (evidenced or proposed neuroectodermal). Some paraneurons are mainly endocrine in function, while others are sensory. Some should be called interneurons. There are graduations between these types of paraneurons; also a definite boundary between neurons and paraneurons can not be determined. Different types of paraneurons (together with some related neurons) are shown in Figure 1. Comments and discussions were given on the neuron-like characteristics of the individual paraneurons.

Histochemical and ultrastructural examinations were performed on neuroepithelial bodies (N. E. B.) in the lung of the mouse and rat. The N. E. B. were identified as specialized groups of pale, columnar cells. They were located throughout the intrapulmonary airway. These cells displayed some special cytochemical properties also seen in the APUD (Amine Precursors Uptake and Decarboxylation) endocrine system, such as cytoplasmic argyrophilia and the capability of selective uptake of amine precursors. Ultrastructrally the N. E. B. were composed of a kind of granulated cell which had concentrations of specific cored vesicles in the basal cytoplasm. It seemed likely that the cells released the contents of the cored vesicles into the extracellular space by exocytosis. These cells made extensive and intimate contact with the mitochondria-rich nerve terminals which occurred mainly at the level of the supranuclear portions of the granulated cells. In this contact area, the membrane of the nerve terminals were apposed to that of the granulated cells with a consistent gap of about 20 nm. Among these membrane appositions, some membrane thickenings were observed in which cored vesicles were closely associated in the granulated cell cytoplasm. From these observations, it was conceived that the lung N. E. B. function both as receptor and endocrine organs and that their specific cored vesicles may have an intimate correlation with these dual functions.

Cimetidine, an H2-receptor, antagonist, and carbenoxolone sodium, a drug used to stimulate gastric mucus synthesis and increase the life span of gastric epithelial cells, were studied to determine their possible prophylactic effect on the formation of stress ulcers, gastric transmucosal potential difference and  gastric pH in rats, using a restraint stress model. The number of ulcers substantially decreased in the rat groups receiving either cimetidine or carbenoxolone pretreatment for two or more days before stress. When the drugs were used in combination, there was an additive effect, since there was a significant decrease in ulcer formation even after half a day of pretreatment. When antacids were used, there was also decreased ulcer formation with half a day of pretreatment. Gastric pH was significantly increased from control levels in all the groups treated with antacid, cimetidine and carbenoxolone. Both cimetidine and carbenoxolone, either alone or in combination, prevented the decrease in potential difference that was produced in the untreated stressed rats. This study suggests that either cimetidine or carbenoxolone, and particularly their combination, may be a useful prophylactic regimen for the prevention of stress ulceration in patients subjected to severe stress.

Experiments with rumen-fistulated dairy cows were performed to study the effect of NaOH-addition to cereal pellets. Compared to straw-concentrate rations in which the straw pellets were free of NaOH, cereal straw pellets containing 2.4 kg NaOH per 100 kg straw caused the rumenal pH to go up from 6.21 to 6.47, the cellulotlytic activity to rise by some 20%, and the passage turnover rate of dry matter to increase from 0,039 to 0,056. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids and the fermentation patterns were not influenced by the NaOH-content of the pellets. It is concluded that NaOH-addition during straw pelleting has a favourable effect on digestion in the bovine rumen.

NADP-linked dehydrogenases, glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (G 6PDH) 6-P gluconate dehydrogenase (6 PGDH), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), malate dehydrogenase decarboxylating (ME) and aminotransferases GOT and GPT were analyzed in the soluble fraction of blood free homogenates. Glutmate dehydrogenase (GDH) was assayed in the mitochondrial fraction. TAM was i.p. administered to male albino rats (50 mg/kg/day) for 28 days. enzyme activities were determined as described by Bermeyer 1965 (Methods Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie. Acad. Press).

Carbromal is metabolized extensively in humans. The major metabolites known to date are bromoethylbutyramide, ethylbutyrylurea and inorganic bromide. After ingestion of a therapeutic dose of 1.0 g carbromal (4.2 mmoles) by four healthy volunteers highest concentrations in serum were found to be for carbromal 30 mumoles/l, for bromoethylbutyramide up to 20 mumoles/l and for ethylbutyrylurea 2--3 mumoles/l. In patients acutely poisoned by carbromal-containing sedatives serum concentrations measured were in the range of 200 mumoles/l carbromal, 350 mumoles/l bromoethylbutyramide and 50 mumoles/l ethylbutyrylurea. These patients were comatose, apneic, had isoelectric encephalographic records and decreased body temperature. The degree of central nervous depression as judged by clinical signs was found to correlate with the serum concentrations of carbromal and of bromoethylbutyramide. Pharmacological activity and acute toxicity of carbromal and its two metabolites were examined in rats and compared with the activity of phenobarbitone. For intraperitoneal injection LD-50 values were found to be for carbromal 1.8 mmoles/kg, for bromoethylbutyramide 1.5 mmoles/kg, for ethylbutyrylurea 5.0 mmoles/kg and for phenobarbitone 0.9 mmoles/kg. Carbromal and bromoethylbutyramide severely decreased body temperature. The relative narcotic activity was estimated to be for carbromal = 100; bromoethylbutyramide = 66; ethylbutyrylurea = 33; phenobarbitone = 100. The anticonvulsive activity against pentetrazol-induced generalized seizures was nearly identical for carbromal, bromoethylbutyramide and phenobarbitone. Anticonvulsant activity of ethylbutyrylurea was two to three times less than that of carbromal. Inorganic bromide was found to increase the narcotic activity of carbromal and of bromoethylbutyramide. The findings show that the clinical signs of central nervous system depression seen in patients acutely poisoned with carbromal are caused mainly by unchanged carbromal and by its metabolite bromoethylbutyramide.

Acute administration of Morphine (20 mg/kg/s.c.) in the rat results in a rise of liver tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) expressed as mumoles of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate/100 mg/h. With chronic administration, a tolerance develops to this enzymatic effect. TAT induction is not evident in pregnant rats, given the narcotic, in which enzyme levels are already initially high. After delivery TAT returns to normal levels and it is possible to show both induction and tolerance developing to morphine. Enzyme activity in fetal livers is much lower than that of adult animals: after maternal administration of morphine only a modest TAT increase is seen which is not, however, statistically significant. TAT activity is fully evident in livers of offspring, with much higher mean levels in newborn rats from morphine-treated animals, as a possible consequence of morphine deprivation. In this latter group of newborn rats narcotic administration causes TAT activity to return to levels as high as those of naive animals. On the other hand, morphine administration to the prole of naive rats results in an induction of liver TAT.

Total orthotopic autotransplantation of the small intestine was performed in 22 dogs, allotransplantation--in 13 dogs. Changes in the wall of the graft resulted from the effect of both nonspecific (ischaemia, blockage of lymph outflow, denervation) and specific factors connected with the reaction of tissue incompatibility. Changes caused by the nonspecific factors are demonstrated as lymphostasis, edema of the wall in the graft, atrophy of the villi with epithelial flattening, hyperplasy of the intestinal gland, macrophagal and plasmocytic reaction in the mucous lamina propria, drop in villous-cryptic coefficient and reduction of the absorbing surface of the villi. At autotransplantation, structural-functional changes in the intestine undergo three stages: the stage of acute morphological changes and pronounced functional disturbances (up to 1,5 months); the stage of relative structural stabilization and gradual functional restoration (up to 6 months); the stage of atrophic-hyperplastic changes in the wall and decrease in functional activity of the intestinal graft (followed-up for 15 months). At allotransplantation, depending on the degree of cellular reaction and vascular changes, as well as on the localization of the process in the wall of the graft, a "graft versus host" reaction and a "recipient versus graft" reaction is demonstrated. Peculiar rosettes of plasmocytes have been described as a possible index of the reaction "graft versus host".

The analysis of 30 etiologically deciphered (by the direct Coons method) autopsy observations of acute respiratory diseases in children under 8 is presented. Monoinfections were established only in 6 cases. Morphological examinations of respiratory organs in 24 cases of mixed acute respiratory diseases (associations of virus-bacteria and virus-Mycoplasma pneumoniae-diplostreptococcus) revealed marked circulatory disorders and desquamative, dystrophic, and inflammatory processes in segmental bronchi, bronchioles and alveoles. Morphometric studies demonstrated statistically significant differences in the cell composition of infiltrates of interalveolar septa in monoinfections and associated infections.

Cryptorchidism of the mature rat testis led to degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and changes in enzyme patterns and activities. Spermatogenic stages 1-4, containing pachytene primary spermatocytes in late meiotic prophase, and stage 5, containing recently formed round spermatids, were damaged by 48 h. Within 96 h stages showed a loss of germinal cells into the lumen and this was almost complete by 192 h. Acid phosphatase showed increased histochemical activity in the basal area of the seminiferous tubule up to 96 h of cryptorchidism, and at 192 h much of the activity was located in large lipidcontaining bodies within the remaining seminiferous epithelium. Total and free biochemical acid phosphatase decreased during cryptorchidism in parallel with cell loss; there were no significant changes in total cathepsin D activity but free enzyme activity was increased throughout the experimental period indicating increased lability of lysosomes in the Sertoli cell. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was mainly tubular but  succinate dehydrogenase also showed interstitial activity. Lipoamide dehydrogenase (NADH) was found mainly in the interstitium. During cryptorchidism both lactate and succinate dehydrogenase activity decreased in the tubules parallel to the loss of germinal cells, whereas lipoamide dehydrogenase (NADH) activity increased in both interstitial and tubular areas. It is suggested that the initial lesion in the seminiferous epithelium, produced by cryptorchidism is in the Sertoli cell and that germ cell damage may result from reduced function of the Sertoli cell.

Glutamine-dependent CPSase, ATCase, and DHOase from Drosophila, the first three enzymes in pyrimidine biosynthesis, show coordinate variation in activity throughout development. The three activities were highest in first instar larvae and decreased as development proceeded. The three activities cosediment in sucrose gradients as a single peak with a relative sedimentation coefficient of approximately 30S. CPSase, ATCase, and DHOase copurify during (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and during DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite chromatography.

A mutant Hadnl was induced in Drosophila melanogaster and found to be deficient in beta-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase. This mutation was utilized to study the genetics and physiological expression of Had+ . Had+ was mapped to the X chromosome at 54.4 and seems to be the structural gene for the enzyme. Enzyme activity in male and female flies indicates that the gene shows both dosage compensation independent from dose effect and differential activity during ontogeny. Electrophoretic mobility data indicate that the enzyme is a dimer which forms by random association of subunits. The fact that the mutant shows no detrimental effect implies that the enzyme is dispensable, at least under laboratory conditions. The biological and technical implications of this gene--enzyme system are discussed.

The disposition of fazadinium was studied in 10 patients with normal hepatic and renal function undergoing abdominal surgery. The serum and urinary concentrations were determined fluorimetrically. A single dose of fazadinium 1.5 mg kg-1 was administered i.v. The plasma decay curve for fazadinium was found to be diphasic and the data were interpreted according to a two-compartment open model. The half-lives of the distribution and elimination phases were 12.3 and 76.4 min respectively. The total apparent volume of distribution averaged 234 ml kg-1 and the plasma clearance 132 ml min-1. From these results it is suggested that fazadinium should have a shorter duration of action than other non-depolarizing agents because of the more rapid decline of the serum concentration corresponding mainly to the short half-life of the beta phase. This rapid elimination phase of fazadinium did not correspond to an extensive biotransformation because fazadinium was excreted almost unchanged in the urine and this excretion accounted for 50% of the injected dose within 24 h.

A high performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of sulphamethoxazole and its metabolite N4-acetylsulphamethoxazole is described. The renal excretion rate and cumulative renal excretion of sulphamethoxazole is markedly influenced by urinary pH. With constant urinary pH, the renal excretion rate and the renal clearance of sulphamethoxazole is dependent on the urine flow. The renal clearance of the metabolite N4-acetylsulphamethoxazole is not influenced by urinary pH or urine flow. No clear acetylator phenotype could be detected in the group of volunteers studied. The extent of acetylation depends on the amount of sulphamethoxazole available for acetylation, thus indirectly on the urine pH and flow.

Chlorazepate, a long-acting benzodiazepine, allayed anxiety before operation, being superior to placebo in a double-blind study in which the drug was given the night before surgery. Long-term relief of apprehension before surgery by the administration of chlorazepate, combined with a narcotic analgesic when indicated, is advocated.

1. Rimiterol and isoprenaline produced significant dose-related increases in cardiac output. 2. These changes in cardiac output were accompanied by increases in heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption which were similar for each drug and dose-related. 3. Isoprenaline in contrast with rimiterol produced direct coronary vasodilation, i.e. coronary vasodilation in excess of that required to meet increases in myocardial oxygen demands. 4. It is suggested that the beta-adrenergic receptors in the human coronary vasculature are mainly of the beta1 type. 5. Rimiterol, because it does not produce direct coronary vasodilation may be preferable to isoprenaline in the treatment of low-cardiac output syndrome where there is regional myocardial ischaemia, since it would be less likely to produce a "coronary steal" effect.

13C nuclear magnetic resonance has been used to characterize quantitatively the cis-trans isomerism about both peptide bonds in the tripeptides Ser-Pro-Pro and Arg-Pro-Pro. Detailed pH titration data indicate that the configuration about both peptide bonds is closely linked to titration of the terminal carboxyl group and, to a lesser extent, to titration of the terminal amino group. The Pro2 C-3 resonance has been found particularly useful for interpretation due to its sensitivity to the isomerization about both peptide bonds. Analysis of the probabilities of the trans-trans, cic-cis, cis-trans, and trans-cis isomers in aqueous solution indicates a stability decrease in the order given. Similarities in the isomerization behavior of the two peptides indicate that side chain interactions involving the first residue have very little effect on the observed cis/trans ratios. The sensitivity of the cis/trans ratio to titration of the terminal amino group is most readily explained on the basis of an indirect effect on carbonyl-carbonyl repulsion.

The accumulation of Ca2+ ions in intact human erythrocytes leads to the production of membrane protein polymers larger than spectrin. The polymer has a heterogeneous size distribution and is rich in gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine cross-links. Isolation of this isodipeptide, in amounts as high as 6 mol/10(5) g of protein, confirms the idea [Lorand L., Weissmann, L.B., Epel, D.L., and Bruner-Lorand, J. (1976), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 73, 4479] that the Ca2+-induced membrane protein polymerization is mediated by transglutaminase. Formation of the polymer in the intact cells is inhibited by the addition of small, water-soluble primary amines. Inasmuch as these amines are known to prevent the Ca2+-dependent loss of deformability of the membrane, it is suggested that transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking may be a biochemical cause of irreversible membrane stiffening.

The effect of ring substituents on the rates of deacylation of 8 meta- and para-substituted benzoyl papains was evaluated. The rate constants were found to depend upon a single ionizing group of pKa = 4.2--4.3, and to decrease by a factor of approximately 2.2 when measured in 94% D2O/H2O. The rates of deacylation are increased greatly by electron-withdrawing groups on the benzene ring. The Hammett rho value is 2.74 +/- 0.32. A plot of the rate constants for deacylation of the benzoyl papains against the corresponding constants for substituted benzoyl chymotrypsins generates a straight line of slope 1.0. This result suggests a very similar distribution of charge on the benzoyl moiety in the transition state for the two enzymes, which is interpreted in terms of the net charge of the transition state for the deacylation of nonspecific acyl papains being equal to--1 with the general base catalyzed assistance to the attack of water on the acyl enzyme being provided by the negatively charged Asp-158 rather than by the neutral Asn-175-His-159 hydrogen bond network. This result together with a survey of literature data suggests that the role of Asp-158 in papain catalysis has been underestimated. The evidence advanced to date in support of the proposition that an imidazolium-159-cysteine-25 thiolate ion pair exists in native papain is evaluated and considered to be insufficient to decide the issue.

Spectrophotometric titration of Formosan cobra cardiotoxin showed that two of the three tyrosyl residues were titrated freely with a normal apparent pKa of 9.6 whereas the remaining one ionized at pH above 11.0. Nitration of cardiotoxin in Tris . HCl buffer with tetranitromethane resulted in the selective nitration of tyrosine 11 and tyrosine 22. It also revealed that tyrosine 51 was the abnormal one in the spectrophotometric titration. Complete nitration occurred in the presence of 6.0 M guanidine hydrochloride. Compared with the conformation of native cardiotoxin, the peptide conformation of the partially nitrated cardiotoxin did not change significantly but the conformation of the completely nitrated cardiotoxin changed remarkably. The biological activity of cardiotoxin was indeed affected by nitration, but the immunological activity was nearly intact even when all the tyrosine residues were nitrated.

Canavalin is a tetramer with 6 tyrosines per subunit. In the work presented here, we have classified these tyrosines by their spectrophotometric and fluorometric pH titration and their ability to be quenched I-. Of the 6 residues, 2 were found to be exposed to the solvent. One (pK = 10.2) contributes 28% of the total fluorescence intensity; the second has a pK of 11.50, and a lower quantum yield, contributing only 16% of the total intensity. The remaining 4 residues (pK = 12.5, contributing 54% of fluorescence intensity) are buried; their titration is irreversible, requiring protein denaturation.

The 270 MHz 1H-NMR spectrum of soya bean lipoxygenase-1 (linoleate: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.11.12) was investigated at 298 K and at several pH values. A large fraction of the protein (50%) was found to be effectively random coil.

The nature of electron-acceptor groups in the system of lysozyme with its substrate-inhibitors has been studied in a wide range of pH values by the method of photosensitized electron transfer. In the lysozyme molecule disulphide bonds and peptide groups are the electron--acceptor groups. The nature of radicals in irradiated lysozyme depends on pH. At complex-formation of lysozyme with oligomeres of N-acetylglucosamine the electron transfer from the enzyme molecule to N-acetyl group of the substrate-inhibitor molecule is realized. Under conditions ruling out complex-formation of lysozyme with the inhibitors (N-acetylglucosamine and its dimer) the electrons are localized on disulphide bonds of the protein molecules at alkaline pH and at pH less than or equal to 3 the radicals are observed which are due to the remove of hydrogen atom from the Calpha-atom of the protein polypeptide chain.

Fluorescence of the suspension of cell nuclei from rat liver was investigated under neutral pH range. The pH decrease from 7 to 5 causes the quenching of protein fluorescence of nuclei and leads to an increase of the polarization degree of the fluorescence. Buffering properties of the nuclei in this range were detected. The use of 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate as the fluorescent probe permits to find the changes of nuclei surface properties with increasing the proton concentration in the solution. Circular dichroism spectra of nuclei were shown to depend on the pH solution too. It was suggested that structure state of the nuclei depends on the pH solution. The structural changes are reversible in the physiological pH range and were concluded to be in the envelope and chromatin of the nuclei. The role of histidine residues of nuclear proteins in the initiation of the structure changes was discussed. It was supposed that structure changes of the nuclei in the physiological pH range have an essential functional role.

Development of autonomic nervous control of basal heart rate was studied in unanesthetized fetal lambs (93 days to term) and newborn lambs (2--29 days), using atropine and/or propranolol blockade. Fetal lambs showed a progressive increase in parasympathetic restraint of heart rate; vagal influence in the newborn lamb was similar to the term fetus. Sympathetic stimulation of fetal heart rate declined toward term, possibly due to the strongly increasing parasympathetic influence. Sympathetic influence in the newborn was similar to the early-gestation fetus. Intrinsic heart rate was about 185 beats/min throughout the fetal and newborn life span studied. Thus changes in basal heart rate resulted from a different balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the autonomic nervous outflow.

This report concerns the investigation of the sensitivity, temperature dependence, accuracy, and the standard electrode potential EO of an antimony thin film pH electrode which was prepared with electron beam evaporation techniques. The air-formed oxide film on antimony thin film electrodes has been proved by both the cathodic reduction method and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The antimony thin film electrode responded rapidly to pH changes and its sensitivity was slightly changed depending on the buffer composition. The accuracy of this electrode was compared with that of the glass electrode. Temperature had some influence on the function of this electrode. The standard electrode potential of this electrode was discussed together with that of other forms of antimony electrodes. The structure and thickness of the surface oxide on antimony thin film electrodes was confirmed by cathodic reduction and ESCA. It was clear that the surface oxide governs the electrode reactions. Possible applications of the antimony thin film electrode are discussed stating some limitations in the use.

Experiments were conducted on rabbits with tetanus intoxication induced by the intravenous injection of a lethal dose of the toxin; a study was made of the therapeutic efficacy of the acetylcholinesterase reactivators--dipyroxim and isonitrosine, and also of the central cholinolytics--amizyl and diphacyl. In dose of 25 mg/kg dipyroxim produced no therapeutic effect, and in doses of 30--40 mg/kg caused the animal death. Amizyl and diphacil in a dose of 3--4 mg/kg caused elimination of tonic convulsions for 1 1/2--2 hours. As to isonitrosin--it produced the same effect for 4--5 hours. In case of combined administration of reactivators and cholinolytics convulsions were eliminated for 4--5 hours.

Gastric aspirates were obtained from 12 healthy volunteers, 49 patients with duodenal ulcer, 14 with gastric ulcer and 35 with gastric carcinoma. The mean total viable bacterial counts in these groups were as follows: volunteers 0, duodenal ulcer 3.8 X 10(1), gastric ulcer 6.95 X 10(4), carcinoma 1.9 X 10(7) organisms/ml. The incidence of wound sepsis in patients without antibiotic cover was; duodenal ulcer 17 per cent, gastric ulcer 38 per cent, carcinoma 56 per cent. Regardless of the underlying pathology, patients with counts greater than 5 X 10(6) organisms/ml in the gastric aspirate had a 93 per cent incidence of wound sepsis, compared with 16 per cent in patients with counts of less than 5 X 10(6) organisms/ml (P less than 0.001). In the group with high counts all except one of the wound infections were caused by organisms present in the stomach at the time of operation. There was a good correlation in the bacteriology of apirates obtained during preoperative endoscopy compared with operative nasogastric samples (n = 31) both for viable counts (r = 0.93) and for the counts of individual organisms. Therefore, preoperative endoscopy can be used to identify patients who are at risk of developing wound sepsis after gastric surgery.

Thiocyanate-assimilatig bacterium, TK 21, was isolated from activated sludge used for the treatment of thiocyanate contained in coke-oven liquor. This organism oxidized thiosulfate and elemental sulfur, causing a decrease of pH of the medium. These facts indicated that it belongs to the genus Thiobacillus. Potassium thiocyanate (0.5 g/l) was completely assimilated during 60 h. Thiosulfate inhibited the assimilation of thiocyanate but elemental sulfur did not. This bacterium did not evolve cyanide as its oxidation product after the decomposition of thiocyanate. The isoalted bacterium was identified as Thiobacillus thioparus. Examination of the composition of cellular fatty acid of three strains of T. thioparus showed that they prossessed 3-hydroxy fatty acid of C10 and C12; saturated straight chains of C10, C12, C15, C16, C17, and C18; monounsaturated straight chains of C16 and C18; and cyclopropane acid of C17.

The bacterial oxidation of naturally occurring gallium-bearing chalcopyrite concentrate and a pure synthetic gallium (III) sulfide has been investigated at pH 1.8 and 35 degree C, using an active culture of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. This oxidation process may proceed by direct or by indirect bacterial action. The highest dissolved gallium and copper concentrations were about 2.2 and 40.2 g/l, respectively. The order of the specific rate of oxygen uptake by T. ferrooxidans in approximately CuFES2 greater than or equal to gallium-bearing CuFeS2 greater than FeS2 greater than Cu2S greater than Cu2S greater than Ga2S3.

Cyclophosphamide, an extensively used cancer chemotherapeutic agent, requires metabolic activation through a mixed-function oxygenase system. The capacity of this agent to produce oncogenic transformation and chromosomal damage, including increases in sister chromatid exchanges, was investigated in cell culture with or without an exogenous liver metabolic activation system. No oncogenic transformation or chromosomal aberrations were produced by cyclophosphamide in the absence of metabolic activation, whereas significant transformation, chromosomal breaks, and increases in sister chromatid exchanges were observed when the activation system was incorporated into the assays. The oncogenic transformation and chromosomal changes were completely eliminated by removing glucose 6-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate from the metabolic generating system. These studies emphasize the necessity to incorporate some activation procedure into short-term assays used for evaluating the mutagenic and/or oncogenic potential of various chemicals.

Trivalent oxygenated phosphorus ligands include alkyl and aryl phosphites, (RO)3P, phosphonites, (RO)2PR, and phosphinites, ROPR2. All such compounds tested, with the exception of triphenyl phosphite, interact with ferrous cytochrome P-450 and its denatured form, cytochrome P-420, to produce complexes having two peaks in the Soret region of their optical difference spectra. Careful evaluation of these spectra indicate that they arise for different reasons for each of the two cytochromes. Clear evidence shows that cytochrome P-450 is not denatured by these ligands. The high affinity of these ligands for heme iron is indicated by small Ks values. The experimental results are used to substantiate a theory of the origin of microsomal double Soret spectra and the nature of the environments available for microsomal cytochromes P-450 and P-420.

Incubation of trichlorofluoromethane with a liver microsomal fraction and an NADPH generating system under anaerobic conditions produced a metabolite dichlorofluoromethane, characterised by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The metabolic reaction was carried out by liver microsomes from the mouse, rabbit, hamster and rat and was increased by phenobarbitone pre-treatment. The formation of dichlorofluoromethane in vitro was enhanced by the addition of FMN, but partially inhibited by the presence of air, oxygen, SK&F 525-A, metyrapone and carbon tetrachloride and totally inhibited by carbon monoxide. The consumption of NADPH in the reaction was greater than could be accounted for by the production of dichlorofluoromethane indicating the possible formation of other metabolic products. It is suggested that trichlorofluoromethane interacts with the reduced form of cytochrome P-450 at the oxygen binding site and a possible mechanism for its subsequent reductive dechlorination is proposed.

We studied and compared the effects of 5- and 6-hydroxydopamine (5- or 6-OHDA) on venous tone and on adrenergic and nonadrenergic responses of the isolated canine saphenous vein. In the tissue bath, both 5- and 6-OHDA caused increases in tone and abolished adrenergic responses to transmural nerve stimulation. Effects of 6-OHDA were blocked by desmethylimipramine. 6-OHDA reduced norepinephrine levels of venous strips to 15% of those in control strips. Neither 5- nor 6-OHDA markedly altered peak contractile responses to norepinephrine but 6-OHDA prolonged the response to norepinephrine. Both compounds reduced responses to tyramine, with 6-OHDA producing a greater reduction than 5-OHDA. Large contractile responses to 5-OHDA were blocked only partially by treatment of strips with 6-OHDA, suggesting that contractile responses to 5-OHDA were mediated by direct and indirect actions. These results suggest differences in the actions of 5- and 6-OHDA on adrenergic terminals and smooth muscle in saphenous veins. The results of the experiments suggest that both 5- and 6-OHDA may be useful pharmacological interventions for the study of adrenergic mechanisms in isolated blood vessels.

Soluble arylsulfatase (EC 3.1.6.1) is present in the body fluids of man in the form of two isoenzymes, arylsulfatase A and B, which reportedly are useful biochemical markers for certain types of malignancy. However, rapid assay of the individual isoenzymes is extremely difficult; procedures based on differential inhibition or activation of the isoenzymes in a mixture yield only semiquantitative results. A feature of these isoenzymes is their inhibition by some common anions (notably phosphate) at physiologic concentrations. The isoenzymes can be separated by anion-exchange chromatography, the B isoenzyme being eluted in the void volume and the A isoenzyme and the anionic inhibitors retarded. Lead is used to sequester phosphate, enabling measurement of A in the salt-eluted fraction. Using this technique, we have found significant elevations of B in the sera of patients with colorectal cancer. The potential of rapid, chromatographic separation coupled with continuous monitoring for arylsulfatase activity is discussed.

Variable amounts of residual 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-glucosidase activity gave rise to difficulties in the diagnosis of Gaucher's disease using spleen and particularly liver. Soluble and particulate components of beta-glucosidase, which interfere with the diagnosis, may be eliminated by preincubation of homogenates at pH 3.0 or with 100 mM sodium chloride at pH 4.0. After either of these treatments the optimum of acid beta-glucosidase was pH 4.5 and diagnosis of Gaucher's disease could be more easily made using homogenates of spleen and liver. There was residual acid beta-glucosidase activity in one of the Gaucher livers.

A patient with methylmalonic and beta-hydroxy-n-valeric aciduria, apparently due to deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, is described. The excretion of beta-hydroxy-n-valerate did not parallel that of beta-hydroxypropionate and methylmalonate but was observed, together with beta-keto-n-valerate, only during ketosis. beta-Hydroxy-n-valerate excretion thus correlates primarily not with the pool size of propionyl-CoA but with that of acetyl-CoA, and may occur during ketosis in any disorder causing accumulation of propionyl-CoA.

The concurrence of the infantile and adult form of acid maltase deficiency in one family is presented. The muscle of both cases possesses residual activity. The glycogen amount in the infantile form is increased tremendously, while in the late-onset the amount of glycogen is normal.

1. Two main physiopathological approaches to the treatment of hypertension are discussed, the first based on renin profiling and the second on haemodynamic measurements. 2. Reduction in plasma renin activity does not appear to be a clinically important mechanism in the hypotensive effect of beta-adrenergic blockers and of alpha-methyldopa. In particular, alpha-methyldopa has been found equally effective as a hypotensive agent both in normal renin and in low renin hypertensive patients. 3. Diuretics are certainly possessed of a renin-stimulating action, but in most patients this action does not obscure the hypotensive effect of these drugs. 4. Responders and non-responders to the hypotensive activity of beta-adrenergic blockers do not differ among them in their control haemodynamics.

1. During acute injection of alpha-methyldopa there is a reduction in the blood pressure within a period of a few hours and a modest reduction in the cardiac output, sometimes due to a modest decrease in heart rate. Frequently the total peripheral resistance is decreased. In contrast, acute injection of beta-blockers induces a marked decrease in heart rate and cardiac output, a compensatory increase in the total peripheral resistance and no decrease in the blood pressure. 2. During long-term use alpha-methyldopa frequently reduces the total peripheral resistance and the reduction in cardiac output is usually modest, at rest as well as during exercise. The beta-blockers reduce the blood pressure, but induce a marked decrease in cardiac output and heart rate. The total peripheral resistance is little affected compared to the pre-treatment level.

Conclusions are difficult to draw. In the six studies of immunotherapy of AML discussed, all the three employing BCG and cells showed a prolongation of survival and the major contributing factor to this prolongation of survival was extension of life after relapse. In the three studies using BCG alone only one shows a beneficial effect, but some more time must be allowed to elapse before this can be concluded with confidence.

A Phase I evaluation of a new adrenoceptor blocker, pamatolol, was performed in 10 healthy male volunteers. Minor reductions in standing and exercise and isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate were observed with the 10-mg oral dose and appeared maximal with the 400-600 mg dose. The rate of decline of effect averaged 1.5% of the exercise heart rate/hr. Neither resting systolic time intervals nor post-exercise pulmonary function was affected by this dose range of pamatolol. Based on the latter responses and the isoproterenol dose response curve, we tentatively conclude that pamatolol is relatively cardioselective in man.

In order to assess the subjective effects of nefopam, a new non-opiate analgesic, a study was designed using highly educated, young, middle-to-upper class subjects in a naturalistic setting. Results suggest that the design is capable of differentiating variations in subjective drug effects. On a number of measures, 10 mg of d-amphetamine, a modest dosage, could be distinguished from placebo, showing changes in the direction expected for stimulant drugs. Nefopam (90 mg), on the other hand, showed few differences from placebo or caffeine (300 mg). Nefopam appeared mildly dysphoric, rather than stimulant, in subjective effects.

1. Enterocytes, isolated from the proximal jejinum and distal ileum of the rat, were homogenized and their organelles separated by isopycnic centrifugation on continuous sucrose density gradients. The distributions of marker enzymes for the principal organelles, RNA and protein were determined in the sucrose gradients and related to the activities per entercocyte. 2. In the jejunum the modal equilibrium densities of the various organelles were: brush borders (1.20), lysosomes (1.20), peroxisomes (1.19), mitochondria (1.17) and basal-lateral membranes (1.13). The values were not significantly different in the ileum. The activities of brush-border enzymes, soluble and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, soluble and membrane-associated lactate dehydrogenase and particulate protein content, however, were greater in the jejunal than the ileal enterocytes. 3. Detergent exposed latent alkaline phosphatase activity in jejunal enterocytes and indicated that this enzyme is present not only in the brush border but also in the basal-lateral membrane and soluble fractions of the cell. 4. Isolated jejunal brush-border preprations showed latent activities of both alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase whereas the activities of alpha-glucosidase and leucyl-beta-naphylamidase were not affected by detergent. Mechanical disruption of these preparations suggested the presence of two forms of alkaline phosphatase in the brush border and provides a technique to assess membrane fragility.

1. Plasma and urine free dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) were measured in six normal male volunteer subjects and the urinary clearance of dopamine was calculated for each subject. 2. The excretion rates for free dopamine in man were greater than could be explained by simple renal clearance. It was concluded that free dopamine must, therefore, be formed in the kidney. 3. Changes in urinary dopamine excretion were studied in four groups of rats initially maintained on low sodium diet and then given equimolar dietary supplements of NaCl, NaHCO3, KCl or NH4Cl, to study the specificity of the previously observed increase in dopamine excretion after increased dietary NaCl. 4. The mean dopamine excretion increased significantly in rats given NaCl, KCl and NH4Cl, whereas dopamine excretion decreased in those given NaHCO3. 5. The failure of dopamine excretion to rise in response to loading with NaHCO3 was unexpected, and argues against a simple effect of volume expansion by the sodium ion. The increase in dopamine excretion with KCl and NH4Cl showed that this response was not specific to the sodium ion.

1. The effects of varying PCO2 on lactate uptake and intracellular pH (pHi) were studied in the isolated rat liver perfused with differing concentration of lactate. 2. In general, pHi and lactate uptake are inversely related to PCO2, and pHi and lactate uptake are directly related to each other, but the quantitative aspects and significance of these relationships vary with the availability of lactate. A model of hepatic lactate metabolism is proposed which may account for the quantitative variation. 3. The metabolism of lactate within the hepatocyte exerts a destabilizing effect on hepatocyte cell pH, in contrast to the buffering effect seen in predominantly glycolytic tissues. 4. An attempt is made to relate the findings to the disturbances of lactate metabolism in clinical respiratory failure.

1. The effects of varying PCO2 on glucose output and the intracellular concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate were studied in the isolated rat liver perfused with differing concentrations of lactate. 2. When the perfusate lactate concentration is above 1.5 mmol/l respiratory acidosis (simulated by high perfusate PCO2) inhibits gluconeogenesis from lactate, whereas respiratory alkalosis stimulates gluconeogenesis. 3. In general there were significant positive correlations between intracellular pH (pHi) and hepatocyte phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate concentrations, and negative correlations between pHi and lactate and pyruvate concentrations; there were usually significant correlations in the opposite  sense between these metabolites and log PCO2. 4. The results suggest that CO2 exerts an inhibitory effect on gluconeogenesis at a step between pyruvate and phosphoenolypruvate; however, this is not the only effect of CO2 on the gluconeogenic sequence. CO2 probably acts by changing pHi, but direct effects of CO2 and HCO-3 cannot be excluded. 5. Except at low lactate concentrations, nonionic diffusion probably does not play a major role in the entry of lactate into the hepatocyte.

The most common initial symptoms in 169 patients with Crohn's disease, followed from 1956 to 1973, were diffuse abdominal pain, diarrhoea without any blood admixture, loss of weight, and fever. At the onset of the disease 84% of patients were aged 10-39 years. The most important complications (in descending order of frequency) were fistulae and abscesses, ileus, anaemia, and malabsorption. A breakdown into active and passive phases indicated that the younger the patient at onset of the disease, the more severe its course. The disease seemed to take a more favourable course when only the colon, but not the terminal ileum, was involved. Recurrence occurred more frequently after a short than after a long preoperative history. Recurrences were more frequent in patients under than over 31 years of age at their first operation.

The metabolism of polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) was studied in vitro by using rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH and atmospheric O2. Quantitative recoveries of all PBBs were obtained after incubations with control or 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) induced microsomes. Of the twelve major components, losses of only peaks 1 (2,4,5,2',5'-pentabromobiphenyl) and 3 (a hexabromobiphenyl) were observed following incubations with microsomes from phenobarbital (PB)- or PBBS- pretreated rats. Of seven structurally identified PBB components, only peak 1 has a bromine-free para position. Peaks 1, 2, and 5 all have two adjacent unsubstituted carbons, yet only peak 1 is metabolized. Of two dibromobiphenyl model compounds studied, the 2,2'-congener was very rapidly metabolized by PB-induced microsomes whereas its 4,4'-isomer was not. These results suggest that the presence of a free para position is required for the metabolism of brominated biphenyls. Of lesser importance appears to be the number of bromines or the availability of two adjacent unsubstituted carbons. In vivo evidence for the metabolism of peaks 1 and 3 was also provided by their drastically diminished levels in liver and milk extracts. When a 14C-PBB mixture consisting almost exclusively of peaks 4 (2,4,5,2',4',5'-hexabromobiphenyl) and 8 (2,3,4,5,2',4',5'-heptabromobiphenyl) was incubated with PB- or PBBs- induced microsomes and NADPH, only traces of radioactivity remained with the microsomes after extensive extraction. However, less radioactivity was bound to microsomes from MC pretreated or especially control rats. No radioactivity was bound to exogenous DNA included in similar microsomal incubations, regardless of the type of microsomes used. Under the same conditions, [3H]-benzo[a]pyrene metabolites were bound to DNA, and PBB-induced microsomes enhanced this binding more than six-fold.

5'-Nucleotidase is purified from lymphocyte plasma membranes by two affinity chromatographies. The first one, on Lens culinaris lectin-Sepharose 4B yields a fraction of twelve lectin-binding glycoproteins (lectin-receptor fraction). The second one on 5'-AMP-Sepharose 4B leads to pure enzyme. This enzyme is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 130 000; it gives a single band in polyacrylamide/dodecylsulfate electrophoresis and displays a very high specific activity (2500-3000 mumol Pih-1mg-1). Some properties of purified 5'-nucleotidase are similar to those of membrane-bound enzyme: substrate specificity, temperature dependence, effects of ions and SH-blocking reagents. Others are completely different for the two systems and these differences result from an interaction between the enzyme molecule and other Lens culinaris lectin binding proteins.

A purification procedure is described by which aspartate transcarbamylase was obtained from cultured cells of Drosophila melanogaster as part of a high-molecular-weight enzyme complex. The complex is shown to contain several polypeptides. An antiserum directed against the complex enzyme inhibited in vitro the activity of aspartate transcarbamylase, carbamylphosphate synthetase and dihydro-orotase which were shown to copurify on a sucrose gradient and by gel electrophoresis. A fast preparation procedure using this antiserum yielded a 220 000-molecular-weight protein in addition to the polypeptides present in the complex. A purification procedure is also described to obtain aspartate transcarbamylase from second instar larvae of Drosophila. At this stage, the enzyme is not complexed with carbamylphosphate synthetase and dihydro-orotase but exhibits the same molecular weight as the aspartate transcarbamylase moiety found in the high-molecular-weight complex of cultured cells.

The pH dependence of papain catalysis was analyzed by a scheme which evaluates the kinetic contribution of both protonated and unprotonated species of functional groups involved in catalysis. Kinetic measurements were made at constant pH, without buffers, by automatic titration. The rate-determining step for papain-catalyzed hydrolysis of alpha-N-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester, determined by nucleophile competition, changed from acylation below pH 6.5 to mixed acylation-deacylation above pH 6.5. Kinetic analysis indicated that three prototropic groups governed the pH-specificity of alpha-N-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester hydrolysis. These prototropic groups had pKa values of 4.8, 6.5 to 6.7, and 8.7. Theoretical treatment of the kinetics provided an excellent fit with the experimentally found profile when the contribution of all three prototropic groups was considered. Analysis showed that, in acid, the pathways of papain catalysis were functional with either two or three active-site protons. In base, a single functional ionic pathway is associated with an active site with only one proton. Pathways involving an unprotonated active site are catalytically inoperative in both acid and base. These results indicate that papain exhibits several catalytically functional ionic pathways. The results are discussed in terms of pKa assignments, and the mechanism of papain catalysis.

Two siblings with increased levels of serum phenylalanine were detected by newborn screening. The older sibling deteriorated neurologically and mentally, despite early dietary control, and died at the age of 6 1/2 years. In the younger sibling phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in liver tissue was normal. Further investigations revealed increased concentrations of biopterin derivatives in the blood, a low excretion of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid in the urine, and a dihydropteridine reductase deficiency as the cause of hyperphenylalaninaemia. The parents of the siblings showed 50% of the normal dihydropteridine reductase activity in their fibroblasts grown in culture. Neurotransmitter therapy was started in the second child at the age of 6 months and this was followed by distinct neurological and mental improvement.

The effects on postoperative pulmonary function of fresh versus stored blood when priming the heart-lung machine were studied in 49 patients subjected to aortic valvular replacement. The onset of extracorporeal circulation was considered to mimic the conditions of massive blood transfusion. The patients receiving heparinized fresh blood required more oxygen in the respirator than those receiving stored blood, but still had a significantly lower arterial oxygen tension during the first and second postoperative days. The fresh blood patients also showed a tendency to require a larger amount of diuretics to maintain adequate urine output. Pre- and postoperative bleeding and changes in postoperative hematological variables did not differ in the two groups. The results imply that stored blood should be preferable when substituting blood losses.

Numerous authors reported a significant deterioration of heart function induced by aortic cross-clamping. Nevertheless, the aorta has been clamped during various surgical procedures without any complication. We studied the hemodynamic and metabolic variations induced by 20 min thoracic aorta cross-clamping in 6 open-chest dogs. During clamping the most striking modifications were an increase in coronary blood flow of over 65%, an increase in cardiac work of over 77% and an increase in total peripheral resistances of over 68% compared to base values. No significant variations were found in the heart rate and cardiac index. Metabolic parameters, such as O2 consumption and lactate consumption increased significantly during the clamping period. The increase in lactate consumption and the progressive and continuous improvement in oxygenation indexes (lactate/pyruvate, redox potential, excess of lactate) proved the absence of any myocardial anoxia during this period. Within 15--30 min after declamping all hemodynamic and metabolic parameters reverted to values close to basal values. These data strongly suggest that the mammalian heart can tolerate this procedure satisfactorily for a limited period of time. In clinical settings, one should consider the base conditions of the cardiovascular system before transposing these conclusions.

Apomorphine and the putative dopamine agonist, 2-(N, N-dipropyl)-amino-5, 6-dihydroxytetralin induced dose-dependent climbing behaviour in the mouse which was measured in wire mesh lined cages as the percentage of time spent climbing in the 30 min period following the first climb and as the maximum time spent in a single climb throughout the drug effect. These These two measures were generally found to parallel excepting when the interacting agent caused muscular hypotonia. All potential interacting agents were given as pretreatments to determine changes in motor function which may interfere with the climbing induced by 1.0 mg/kg s.c. apomorphine. The possibility of a change in the apomorphine response to a sterotyped biting, which would also interfere with climbing, was also considered. Excluding these non-specific changes, climbing behaviour was shown to be antagonised, dose-dependently, by low doses of typical and atypical neuroleptic agents (haloperidol, fluphenazine, loxapine, pimozide, oxiperomide, clozapin, thioridazine, sulpiride, tiapride and metoclopramide) but not specifically by other psychoactive agents. Climbing behaviour was modified by serotonergic agents; the agonist quipazine reduced or abolished, whilst the antagonists, methysergide and cyproheptadine, enhanced the response. Picrotoxin specifically reduced climbing behaviour but sodium valproate exerted non-specific effects, precluding conclusions as to a GABA involvement. Cholinergic and noradrenergic involvements with climbing were also apparently eliminated by the ineffectiveness of atropine, aceperone, piperoxan and propranolol. The involvement of serotonin with climbing was extended to the actions of the neuroleptics: the antagonistic effects of typical neuroleptics (haloperidol, fluphenazine, loxapine) were markedly enhanced by combination with methysergide or cyproheptadine whilst the effects of clozapine, sulpiride and thioridazine were significantly reduced. The actions of metoclopramide, oxiperomide, pimozide and tiapride were not generally modified by such combinations. These differences are discussed in terms of differential abilities to induce extrapyramidal disturbances and the mouse climbing model is forwarded as a test with potential to detect antipsychotic agents of different activity spectra.

The dose, serum level and ventricular content of ouabain needed to produce cardiotoxicity were examined in control cats, cats with transected spinal cords and cats with transected spinal cords whose heart rates were restored to control values by artificial pacing. The lethal dose of ouabain was higher in cats with transected spinal cords and not paced than it was in the control group. However, the lethal dose of ouabain in spinal-sectioned cats with ventricular pacing was no different from that in controls. However, in both groups of spinal-sectioned cats, death was associated with higher ventricular and serum levels of ouabain than in controls. The ventricular ouabain content of paced animals with transected spinal cords was higher than that of controls and lower than that of unpaced spinal cats. Thus, restoration of heart rate to control levels in spinal animals appeared to accelerate myocardial ouabain uptake. The lower myocardial ouabain content in the spinal-sectioned animals which were paced suggests that pacing sensitizes the heart to cardiotoxicity. Spinal section itself appears to decrease the sensitivity to ouabain partly through a decrease in cardiac rate and partly through a loss of neurogenic influence.

The conditions under which prolongation of halothane-induced sleeping time in the mouse may be used as a test for centrally acting drugs are described. The test can be recommended for its practical advantages over methods using barbiturates to induce hypnosis; due cognizance must be taken of a diurnal variation in the response of mice to halothane. To assess the usefulness of the test the effects of amphetamine, chlorpromazine, histamine, morphine, nikethamide, pentobarbitone and SKF 525A have been investigated. The interaction between 5 benzodiazepines and halothane has been studied in particular. Results from sleeping time experiments, measurements of body temperature and of brain halothane concentrations suggest that the halothane-benzodiazepine interaction is due to additive CNS depressant effects. It was found that nitrazepam and diazepam were clearly more potent than chlorodiazepoxide, medazepam and oxazepam in respect of their interactions with halothane.

Taenia isolated from the guinea pig caecum were used for the experiments. No inhibitory response of the depolarized taenia to isoprenaline was observed during the significant increase of cyclic AMP level. These observations suggest that the total tissue level of cyclic AMP is not an important determinant of relaxation in the depolarized taenia. Antispasmodics, such as papaverine, benactyzine and Aspaminol (1,1-diphenyl-3-piperidino-butanol hydrochloride) relaxed the depolarized taenia, while the depolarized taenia was not relaxed by concentrations of dibutyryl cyclic AMP sufficient to relax the polarized taenia. Ca uptake by the depolarized taenia was inhibited by papaverine, benactyzine and Aspaminol but not by isoprenaline and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. These results indicate that relaxation of the depolarized taenia induced by the antispasmodics used was mainly due to inhibition of Ca uptake.

There are a variety of molecule species of dopamine avaialable at physiological pH. The predominant form available at physiological pH is the phenolic ammonium salt. However, at the present time the molecular form that is optimum for producing dopaminergic activity is unknown. In attempting to delineate the conformational requirements of dopaminergic agonists, a variety of conformationally restricted analogs and complex molecules possessing a dopaminergic segment have been investigated. It appears at this time that the trans extended form of dopamine is the optimum form for binding to dopamine receptors. The rotameric forms of dopamine are also important considerations when examining a molecule for dopaminergic agonist activity. A high degree of stereospecificity has been shown in different dopaminergic systems.

In experiments on dogs, milid (proglymid) entailed a weak inhibition of the 2nd phase of the gastric secretion leaving intact the 1st phase. The action of LS-519 was obvious in the 1st phase, having entailed a significant inhibition. The glycomacropeptid exerted a strong inhibiting effect both on the 1st and the 2nd phases, the effect lasting longer than that of the first two drugs. All the three drugs not only inhibited the gastric secretion but increased pH, reduced the gastric juice acidity while exerting no significan effect on concentration of common proteinases.

The work output and the mental and physical fatigue generated by a dental procedure is affected by the length and type of operation, physical facilities, the amount of cooperation given by the patient, operating techniques, and the effective teamwork and rapport of the operatory dental team. Fatigue is also generated by stresses that arise outside of the office and which, when superimposed over the normal operating stresses of the office, can have a cumulative effect of decreasing output and increasing mental and physical fatigue for the dentist, the assistant, and the patient. Probably the three most important means to compensate for both routine and nonroutine physical and mental stresses of any type or origin are: (1) learn to cope with or resolve the origin of the stress; (2) develop a pattern of healthy living; (3) cultivate job satisfaction.

Human gastric mucosal adenylate cyclase has been shown to be sensitive to histamine and catecholamines. Stimulation of enzyme activity by histamine and catecholamines were selectively blocked by cimetidine and propranolol, respectively. Combination of both hormones at maximally effective concentrations were additive, indicating that human gastric mucosa contains at least two separate hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclases.

A Lineweaver-Burk plot demonstrated that the apparent Michaelis constants are identical for chymotrypsin (CT) in duodenal juice and in feces of the same patient. CT in fecal homogenates exhibits exhibits a remarkable stability and is bound to particles to a considerable but variable extent. The pH optimum of CT in human feces is somewhat higher as compared to pure bovine pancreatic CT. All measurements of fecal CT activity should, therefore, be performed at pH 9.0. The distribution of CT among the fecal mass has been investigated. There were considerable differences between CT activities in random fecal specimens and in the corresponding stool collections. However, if the results were expressed in terms of 'normal' and 'abnormal', 113 out of 120 random fecal specimens gave the same results as the corresponding stool collections. It is concluded that the risk of 'false-normal' values cannot be effectively reduced by determination of CT outputs in stool collections (or by using continuous markers) instead of CT activities in random stool specimens.

Rupture of an aneurysm of the mesentergic artery caused severe intestinal hemorrhage in a 50-year-old woman with polyarteritis nodosa. Abdominal angiography not only established diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa by demonstrating multiple visceral aneurysms but also localized the site of bleeding.

The radiographic triad of a calcified pancreatic mass, duodenal ulcers, and nephrocalcinosis should suggest the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, as part of the multiple endocrine adenomatosis complex. The clinical and radiographic features of the entity are described in this case report.

Two-hundred-and-two patients with alcoholic liver disease whose investigations included a liver biopsy were seen in a district general hospital over a seven year period. Thirty-five percent presented with general gastrointestinal symptoms rather than with overt liver disease or previously recognised excess consumption of alcohol. Recognition of the alcohol problem was assisted by the finding of a raised mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and/or gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP). The use of these methods of detection is discussed in relation to the rapid rise in alcohol consumption in the United Kingdom, and the high mortality of cirrhosis reported from special centres. Twnety-two per cent of the patients were found to have an established cirrhosis, and there was some evidence that the women were more susceptible to some of the toxic effects of alcohol. Early detection can be enhanced by a high level of suspicion, wider recognition of the significance of a high MCV, and the greater use of GGTP estimations.

Duodenal function was studied in 11 healthy volunteers after intragastric instillation of a mixed semi-elemental meal. The duodenum accepted chyme of varying pH, osmolality, and nutrient concentration; and, as a result of biliary, pancreatic, and enteric secretion as well as absorption, it delivered chyme with nearly constant pH, osmolality, and nutrient concentration to the jejunum. The flow rate and nutrient load of jejunal chyme varied. The duodenum absorbed more carbohydrate than lipid and less protein, taking up each nutrient at a constant rate during most of the postprandial period. The percentage of nutrient load absorbed was greatest in the late postprandial period, when flow rate, nutrient load, and concentrations were low.

The surface pH of human proximal jejunum was measured in biopsy samples and found to be more acid than the phosphate buffer in which they were incubated. The in vitro jejunal surface pH was 5.93 +/- 0.05 in control subjects and 6.19 +/- 0.09 in treated coeliac patients. A group of untreated coeliac patients with a surface pH of 6.56 +/- 0.14 had a significantly less acid surface pH compared to controls, as did a group of Crohn's patients with a surface pH of 6.21 +/- 0.04. These two groups with a significantly raised surface pH were subdivisible into 'high' and 'low'groups. Surface pH was found to remain low in the treated coeliac and control groups but became more acid over the incubation period reaching almost normal values in the Crohn's group and the untreated coelic initial surface pH. The raised surface pH in untreated coeliac disease and Crohn's disease would alter the amount of a weak acid available for non-ionic diffusion. Therefore the present results may help to explain the folate malabsorption known to occur in untreated coeliac disease and the frequently seen low serum folate levels in Crohn's disease.

The effects of a variety of agents on guanylate cyclase activity were tested in broken cell preparations of mammary glands from midpregnant mice. Of the agents tested, only phospholipase A, triton X-100, and an impure egg lysolecithin preparation enhanced the activity of guanylate cyclase in mammary gland homogenates; other agents, including sodium azide and phospholipase C, and purified egg lysolecithin had no effect. Phospholipase A increased the activity of guanylate cyclase in the 150,000 g pellet fractions of mammary gland homogenates, bud did not consistently enhance guanylate cyclase in the 150,000 g supernatant fractions. Phospholipase A did not appear to enhance guanylate cyclase activity by solublizing the enzyme from the 150,000 g pellet. Triton X-100, in contrast, appeared to act by solubilizing guanylate cyclase from the material present in the 150,000 g pellet. Triton X-100 increased by several fold guanylate cyclase activity in the tissue homogenates and the 150,000 g pellets, but did not consistently enhance enzyme activity in the 150,000 g supernatant. Triton X-100 had no effect on the apparent Km of guanylate cyclase.

The formation of carcinogenic N-nitrosamines in neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions (pH 6-14) at 25 degrees C is reported using dissolved N2O3 and N2O4 gases. These reactions are very much faster than those with acidified nitrite: typically, 2 X 10(-3) M amine gives ca. 10-50% N-nitrosamine in a few seconds with 5-20 fold excess of nitrogen oxide. The N-nitrosamine yield in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide is independent of amine basicity from pKA 11.2-0.99, but decreases with decreasing pH of the reaction solution for the more basic amines. Significantly, N-nitrosamine yields are not lowered with diluted nitrogen oxides (1000 ppm) and moderately basic amines (eg. N-methylpiperazine) react readily at physiological pH. The mechanism by which these reactions occur is discussed, with particular reference to the existence of two reactive tautomeric forms of N2O3 and N2O4. The formation of carcinogenic N-nitrosamines from NO in ethanol at 25 degrees C is also reported. These reactions are slow in the absence of air (oxygen), I2 or metal salts. Oxygen accelerates nitrosation by converting NO via NO2 to either N2O3 or N2O4, but both I2 and metal salts are effective under anaerobic conditions, where reaction rates are virtually independent of amine basicity but depend on the nature of the added reagent. The most effective substance is I2, which gives quantitative yields of N-nitrosamine in a few minutes at 25 degrees C by forming the reactive nitrosyl iodide (NOI) reagent. Acceleration in ethanol at 25 degrees C is also observed with AgI, CuI, CuII, ZnII, FeIII and CoII salts, among others, with substantial amounts of N-nitrosamine being produced in ca. 30-300 min. Metal iodides intervene by way of the NOI reagent, as for I2, but other salts require a mechanism involving reaction between a metal-amine complex and NO, itself. The results show that carcinogenic N-nitrosamines may form under a much wider range of experimental conditions than suspected hitherto. Their relevance to human exposure is discussed, with particular reference to urban pollution and the effect of dietary antioxidants.

The kinetics of nitrosation of trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylaminoxide (TMAO) to give N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) have been studied. The nitrosation rates of TMA and TMAO, when determined at 100 degrees C in sealed tubes, showed maximum values at about pH 3, while at temperatures lower than 75 degrees C the pH dependence of the nitrosation of these compounds was similar to that observed with alkylamides. The initial rate of NDMA formation from TMAO determined at pH 3.0 and 25 degrees C was found to be proportional to the TMAO and nitrite concentrations, not to the square of the nitrite concentration. In contrast, the rates of NDMA formation from TMA and TMAO when reacted at pH 3.0 and 100 degrees C in sealed tubes were found to be proportional to the square and the cube, respectively, of the nitrite concentration. These results strongly suggest that the NDMA formation at higher temperatures involves the oxidative cleavage of tertiary amines to produce secondary amines (dimethylamine, DMA) which may react with nitrite to form NDMA. On the other hand, at lower temperatures, NDMA may be formed from TMA or TMAO by a pathway not involving DMA.

C-Nitrosophenols, produced by the nitrosation of phenols, catalyse N-nitrosamine formation. The rate of N-nitrosation of pyrrolidine, catalysed by p-nitroso-o-cresol, is fastest at about pH 5. The catalytic species is thought to be the quinone monoxime tautomer of the nitrosophenol. A possible mechanism for the catalysis is proposed. A reaction of pyrrolidine with nitrite at pH 5.0 is described, which gives enhanced N-nitrosation in the presence of p-cresol. The yield of N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) is further enhanced when this reaction is carried out under anaerobic conditions. Nitrosocysteine hydrochloride reacts with N-methylaniline at pH 2.65, 5.5 and 9.75 in the absence of nitrite to give N-nitroso N-methylaniline. The N-nitrosation of morpholine and pyrrolidine at pH 9.75 is also effected by nitrosocysteine hydrochloride. The rate of N-nitrosation at this pH decreases with increasing amine basicity. The reaction of nitrosocysteine with N-methylaniline at pH 9.75 under anaerobic conditions leads to a significant reduction in the yield of N-nitroso-N-methylaniline.

alpha-Tocopherol has been evaluated as a nitrite scavenger for the prevention of nitrosamine formation in a model system and under practical conditions. alpha-Tocopherol was found to react with nitrosating agents in both lipophilic and aqueous environments. The use of alpha-tocopherol was shown to inhibit aminopyrene-nitrite induced hepatotoxicity in rats and to reduce the amount of NDMA formed in cigarette smoke. Of primary interest is the finding of a significant reduction of NPYR formation in fried bacon. Nitrosamine inhibition was greater with alpha-tocopherol used in combination with sodium ascorbate than with sodium ascorbate alone.

Rate enhancements of from 12 to 49-fold occurred when dihexylamine was nitrosated at pH 3.5 in the presence of bacteria and yeast cells at a concentration of 12 mg/ml. Rates were similar in the presence of either boiled or unheated cells. The magnitude of the rate enhancement for nitrosation of other amines depended on the alkyl chain length. A nonenzymatic mechanism involving hydrophobic interactions of the precursor amines and cellular constituents is proposed.

Gastric contents from fasting humans were pooled and analysed for amines. Volatile amines present were dimethylamine, trimethylamine and histamine; non-volatile amines found were cadaverine, putrescine, ethanolamine and tryptamine. Gastric contents from 35 patients, some before and/or after gastric stimulation with histamine or pentagastrin, were analysed for nitrosamines. N-Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) (5-30 microgram/kg) was present in four samples, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) (2 microgram/kg) in two samples and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) (6 microgram/kg) in one sample. pH, nitrite and nitrate determinations were made on some samples. Medical diagnosis of patients could not be correlated with the presence of nitrosamines in the gastric contents.

Serial bleedings were obtained from two mules during prolonged immunization, one with type XXV the other with type VIII pneumococcal vaccine. IgGa, IgGb, IgGc, IgB, IgG(T) and IgM present among purified Pn anti-XXV and Pn anti-VIII immunoglobulin isolated from various bleedings were identified by use of rabbit anti-equine heavy chain specific reagents. Radioimmunodiffusion with 14C-labelled type XXV pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide and horse and donkey reagents with species specificity directed against donkey or horse IgGa respectively, demonstrated both parental horse and donkey IgGa heavy chain isotypes among the anti-PnXXV antibodies of the interspecies hybrid. Qualtitative and quantitative examination of the cross-precipitation of mule anti-PnXXV sera with the capsular polysaccharides of pneumococcal types IV, X and XA, with birch sap, ketha gum, and with polysaccharides of E. coli, Klebsiella and Rhizobium was carried out and compared with data obtained with anti-PnXXV raised in a horse. Analysis of supernatants from the cross-reactions showed that distinct subfractions had reacted. indicating a marked heterogeneity of the antibodies.

Peroxidation of the unsaturated lipid of tissue homogenates is an established method to assess the antioxidant or vitamin E status of animals. In the present study the spontaneous lipid peroxidation in air of rat brain homogenates is reported. The effects of various factors like pH, time, concentration of tissues, temperature, ferrocompounds and catalysis by added tissues like liver are described. Rat brain homogenates appear to be a suitable preparation for in vitro studies of lipid peroxidation.

Interaction of insulin with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was studied in conscious rabbits. Propranolol and metoprolol did not modify the peak of insulin hypoglycaemia but delayed its recovery. Practolol, sotalol and 1-INPEA enhanced the peak effect and delayed the recovery of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. H 35/25 and d-INPEA did not modify insulin hypoglycaemia. The beta-blockers did not produce significant hypoglycaemia per se. Since sotalol, 1-INPEA (specific beta-adrenoceptor antagonists devoid of local anaesthetic activity); practolol and metoprolol (selective cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists) enhanced hypoglycaemic action of insulin and H 35/25 (a selective beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist) failed to affect it, it seems that selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (similar to cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptors) mediates enhancement of insulin hypoglycaemia. Caution should, therefore, be exercised in administering beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and insulin together. A reduction in the dose of insulin may be necessary.

The binding of sisomicin and streptomycin to human serum albumin was studied in the absence of divalent cations by means of the dialysis method. Hydrophobic bonds between albumin and sisomicin or streptomycin can be excluded by nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The presence of hydrogen bonds is made unlikely according to the result that the binding of the aminoglycosides decreases with increasing number of OH groups in the aminoglycoside molecule. The pH dependence of protein binding suggests that ionic bonds are involved in the binding of aminoglycosides. On the basis of the concentration dependence of the albumin binding of sisomicin and streptomycin we determined the binding affinities delta F degrees, the binding constants K1, and the maximum number n of aminoglycoside molecules that can be bound by a molecule of albumin in the absence of Ca++ ions. The results were as follows: Sisomicin: delta F degrees = -4189 cal/mole, K1 = 900 1/mole, n = 12; Streptomycin: delta F degrees = 3512 cal/mole, K1 = 300 1/mole, n = 17.

Light and exhaustive ergometric exercise in untrained male and female medical students in the age group 18-21 years resulted in significant lowering of the blood sugar, cholesterol and pH. Females exhibited hypoglycemia of slightly greater magnitude as compared to male subjects and during both the exercises, however, such sex differences were not observed for changes in cholesterol and pH.

The total and free acetylcholine (Ach) and cholinesterase (CHE) content of adult Setaria cervi were estimated. The Ach was estimated by bioassay on rectus abdominis muscle of frog and the CHE by measuring the drop in pH following incubation of worm homogenate with Ach chloride. The free and total Ach contents (4.0 +/- 0.57 and 6.0 +/- 0.48 microgram/g wet weight of worms respectively) were as high as found in mammalian brain cortex. The cholinesterase activity was found to be 5.57 +/- 0.6 units/g wet weight of worms. It is possible that there may exist a well developed system responsible for the synthesis, storage, release and destruction of Ach and that Ach may be acting as an excitatory neurohormone in S. cervi.

A new synthetic compound, LC-6, has been shown to inhibit the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions induced in rats by mouse reaginic antibody. In this system, the ED50 was 35 mg/kg body weight of LC-6 administered per os. LC-6 prevented neither histamine skin reactions nor the reactions to histamine and other chemical mediators released by 48/80. Therefore, its inhibitory activity is comparable to that of the model anti-allergic compound, disodium cromoglycate (DSCG). In contrast to DSCG, the new drug exhibits the distinct advantage of being active per os and over prolonged periods of time. Its activity has been shown to persist for at least 6 h when doses 4 times higher than the ED50 were administered. The duration of the drug effect was clearly dose-dependent. Predoses of the compound increased its effectiveness. The long-lasting association of LC-6 with mast cells, as indicated by its prolonged inhibitory activity, makes it a valuable tool in the search for receptors involved in anaphylactic reactions.

A quantitative in vitro assay (EPI) was developed for the serological detection of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in cattle. Positive sera inhibit early polykaryocytosis (EP) induced by BLV. We report herein experiments which demonstrate that BLV-induced antibodies are responsible for this inhibition. Serum fractionation by gel filtration and affinity chromatography indicate that EP-inhibiting activity is mediated only by immunoglobulins of the IgG class. Furthermore, on the basis of their ion-exchange chromatographic behaviour, these antibodies were classified as IgG1. We also ruled out the participation in the EP inhibition reaction of the other compounds such as polypeptides, including serum complement and interferon or DNA and RNA. These results demonstrate that EP inhibition by bovine sera is specific to BLV-induced antibodies.

In the present study SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to reinvestigate the conditions under which b-TSH dissociates into its constituent subunits. The effects of SDS, itself, urea, acid pH and temperature were assessed by the decrease in the amount of undissociated TSH and the increase in the dissociated components as revealed by SDS gel electrophoresis. In SDS alone 25--30% dissociation occurred. Pre-treatment with increasing concentrations of urea up to 7.1 M increased the degree of dissociation to 70% after h at room temperature. Maximum dissociation was achieved by treatment at pH 2.5 and 37 degree C for 1 h. In 1 M propionic acid approximately 10% of the TSH was still undissociated after 18 h at 25 degree C.

Long-acting neuroleptics, without offering a therapeutic breakthrough in the treatment of schizophrenia, are nevertheless a definite step in the management of patients with this disorder. The adequate assessment of these agents necessitates methodological considerations to ensure first, just and adequate patient selection, secondly, adaptations to the drug's characteristics, thridly, sufficient duration of the study and finally, special precautions in the assessment of toxicity. Furthermore, the patient management in these studies must ensure continued and easy accessibility of the simultaneously investigating and treating team.

Sodium and chloride net transport in isolated human cornea preparations were found to be pH dependent. Sodium net transport was directed from aqueous humor to tear side at pH 7.6 and 8.6. At pH 7.4, net sodium flux did not differ significantly from zero, and at pH 7.0, net sodium transport was directed toward the aqueous humor side. Chloride net flux at pH 8.6 and 7.6 was also directed from aqueous humor to tear side. Acidification of the bathing solution to pH 7.4 and 7.0 was followed by a decrease in chloride net fluxes to values not significantly different from zero.

Oxygen equilibrium curves of 48 healthy adult subjects have been measured by the method of Rossi-Bernardi et al. (Clin. Chem. 21: 1747, 1975), in which H2O2 is gradually added to a sample of deoxygenated blood that contains an excess of catalase. The mean P50 for nonsmokers was 26.9 Torr and the distribution of values was slightly skewed to the right (range 24.2--29.9 Torr). The method differs from others previously available in that pH, PCO2, and HCO3-- are constant during oxygenation. The system for control of the experiment and data collection and processing has been automated by the use of a microprocessor so that the equilibrium curve can be obtained quickly, reproducibly, and relatively simply. With the aid of a digital computer, the parameters of the generalized Adair equation can also be estimated.

We studied the reactions of human tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle and canine trachealis muscle to adrenergic agonists. Human tissue was obtained from recent autopsies of patients with normal lungs and patients with respiratory disorders, and canine tissue was obtained from animals used in other experiments. The muscle was mounted in tissue baths fitted with platinum wire electrodes and the mechanical activity was recorded. Norepinephrine added to the normal human or canine tissue in concentrations up to 10(-5) M caused no reaction. In the normal human and in the dog, pretreatment with histamine or KCl changed this response and when norepinephrine was added the tissue contracted. This contraction was blocked by phentolamine or N,N'-bis-(O-methoxybenzylaminohexyl)-cystamine tetrahydrochloride (BHC). In diseased tissue, the addition of norepinephrine resulted in a contraction that was blocked by phentolamine or BHC and no pretreatment with histamine or KCl was required. These findings demonstrate alpha-receptors in human and canine airway smooth muscle, and there is a difference between normal and diseased human tissue in the reaction of these tissues to alpha-adrenergic agonists.

The activity of rapamycin, a new anti-Candida antibiotic, was not affected by pH values between 6 and 8; at pH 4, however, activity was abolished. The MIC of rapamycin did not vary drastically with the size of inoculum: a ten-fold dilution of the inoculum reduced the MIC only two-fold. Serum binding was extensive. Serum levels obtained in mice were higher on subcutaneous injection than with oral administration. Dogs absorbed rapamycin after oral administration. Rapamycin cured systemic candidosis in mice: PD50 s.c. was 9.5 mg/kg: PD50 p.o. was 11 mg/kg. In the same experimental infections amphotericin B and nystatin exhibited PD50 values of less than 0.25 mg and greater than 4,000 units/kg respectively. Rapamycin and amphotericin B, administered at 1, 4 and 24 hours after infection, gave approximately the same percent survival after 30 days of observation. When the above treatment was extended by an additional daily treatment for 6 days, rapamycin by the subcutaneous route yielded a higher percentage of survival than either rapamycin or amphotericin B, administered orally, after a 30-day observation period. Vaginal candidosis in female rats was treated efficiently (91% cure) by rapamycin administered orally. No increase of resistance of C. albicans was observed during treatment.

A specific gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) transport system in Escherichia coli K-12 cells with a K(m) of 12 muM and a V(max) of 278 nmol/ml of intracellular water per min is described. Membrane vesicles contained d-lactate-dependent activity of the system. Mutants defective in GABA transport were isolated; they lost the ability to utilize GABA as a nitrogen source, although the activities of glutamate-succinylsemialdehyde transaminase (GSST) (EC 2.6.1.19) and succinylsemialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSDH) (EC 1.2.1.16), the enzymes that catalyze GABA utilization, remained as high as in the parental CS101B strain. The ability to utilize l-ornithine, l-arginine, putrescine, l-proline, and glycine as a nitrogen source was preserved in the mutants. The genetic lesions resulting in the loss of GABA transport, gabP5 and gabP9, mapped in the gab gene cluster in close linkage to gabT and gabD, the structural genes of GSST and SSDH, and to gabC, a gene controlling the utilization of GABA, arginine, putrescine, and ornithine. The synthesis of the GABA transport carrier is subject to dual physiological control by (i) catabolite repression and (ii) nitrogen availability. Experiments with glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2)-negative and with glutamine synthetase-constitutive strains strongly indicate that this enzyme is the effector in the regulation of GABA carrier synthesis by route (ii).

Malate synthases from a thermophilic Bacillus and Escherichia coli have been isolated in a high state of purity. Molecular weights of these two proteins determined in the native state and after denaturation in sodium dodecyl sulfate-mercaptoethanol show that the enzymes are monomeric. This conclusion is supported, for the thermophile enzyme, by the result of an electrophoretic analysis of that protein after treatment with dimethylsuberimidate and denaturation. The thermophilic Bacillus malate synthase is considerably more thermostable than its mesophilic counterparts from E. coli, Bacillus licheniformis, and Pseudomonas indigofera. It is, however, markedly labilized by an increase in the ionic strength of the medium brought about by the addition of 0.2 M potassium chloride or in pH above 9. Increased ionic strength has little effect on the thermostability of the mesophilic bacterial malate synthases. These observations provide strong support for the idea that monomeric proteins in thermophiles owe their unusual heat stability to the presence of salt bridges in their tertiary structure.

There has been a paucity of research in the use of high-dose benzodiazepines in the treatment of severe neurotic anxiety. The author presents five cases, three with excellent and two with poor outcomes. The English and Fench language literature is reviewed and reveals evidence that high-dose benzodiazepines may be useful in the treatment of certain neurotic patients. However, the lack of controlled studies is noted. The author poses several questions important to the future of research on benzodiazepines.

In this multi-clinic double-blind study, patients suffering from insomnia were treated with triazolam 0.5 mg (Halcion) or placebo for 14 days. Four investigators treated 239 patients, 122 on triazolam and 117 on placebo. Thirty-nine patients, 10 on triazolam and 29 on placebo, dropped out for ineffectiveness of the medication and 32 patients, 16 in each group, dropped out for side effects. Analysis of pooled efficacy data showed that triazolam was significantly better than placebo on all efficacy parameters measured, including how much the medication helped the patients sleep, onset of sleep, duration of sleep, duration compared to usual, number of nocturnal awakenings, and feeling of restfulness in the morning. Triazolam did not produce evidence of tolerance development after 2 weeks of treatment. The same variety of side effects occurred on each treatment and primarily included drowsiness, grogginess, headaches, impaired coordination nausea, and dizziness.

This paper presents preliminary data on a new integrated circuit microelectronic pH sensor. The device is extremely miniaturized by the use of integrated circuit technology, and uses the intrinsic hydrogen ion selective properties of the gate insulator material. In order to make the device compatible with aqueous solution monitoring, the silicon dioxide-silicon nitride gate insulator structure is used. The integrated circuit chip was designed, processed, and packaged by a variety of techniques which protect all metal parts from the aqueous solution. Test data are reported on leakage current, sensitivity, reproducibility, linearity, stability, response time, and life. The results indicate that this type of pH sensor may have many significant advantages for biomedical research and application.

We report preliminary results of our experiments directed at fabricating pH-sensitive electrodes suitable for in vivo use by means of thick film screening techniques. Our results show that glass membranes of suitable thickness and possessing nearly theoretical sensitivity to pH can be fabricated by this process. A hybrid electrode structure permits the incorporation of a source follower FET amplifier directly adjacent to the pH membrane, significantly reducing response time and noise pick-up. Extension of the basic electrode structure to accommodate membranes sensitive to other ions is discussed.

The optimum conditions for the selective removal of elastin from connective tissues are described. The process, elastolysis, consists of incubating small samples of connective tissue in buffered saline at ph=8.6 containing 300 microgram/me of a 50-50% mixture of elastase with trypsin inhibitor, for 5-6 hours at room temperature. This process, complimented with other processes for selective removal of lipids, or mucopolysaccharides, or collagen, enables one to examine the contribution of the various components of the connective tissue to its mechanical function. The elastolysis was tested with aortic, valvular and tendon tissues from human, bovine and canine species and it was found that in tensile stress experiments, collagen was unaffected while the low-stress contribution of elastin disappeared.

The penetration and uptake of both radioactive (18F) and stable fluoride (19F) in bovine enamel were investigated. Buffered pH 7 NaF solutions were employed. Penetration profiles of both 18F and 19F in enamel were determined by using a sectioning technique. 18F and 19F concentrations decreased exponentially with increasing penetration distance. The uptake of 18F in enamel can be described by a power function of the immersion time, with an average power of 0.76. The results agree reasonably with our previously published theoretical model for the diffusion in enamel, based on simultaneous diffusion in enamel pores and in the hydroxyapatite crystallites. The diffusion coefficients of fluoride ions in enamel obtained from the application of the model to the results presented here, were: D = 0.9 x 10(-17) cm2/s in the crystallites and D' = 3.3 x 10(-10) cm2/s in the enamel pores. An average penetration depth of fluoride ions at pH 7.0 of 8 micron in 4 hours has been calculated.

The ionophorous properties of a new antibiotic, ionomycin, have been studied. It was found that the antibiotic is capable of extracting calcium ion from the bulk of an aqueous phase into an organic phase. The antibiotic also acts as a mobile ion carrier to transport the cation across a solvent barrier. The divalent cation selectivity order for ionomycin as determined by ion competition experiments was found to be: Ca greater than Mg greater than Sr = Ba, where the binding of strontium and barium by the antibiotic is insignificant. The antibiotic also binds La3+ to some extent, but its complexation with monovalent alkali metal ions is negligible. Measurement of the binding of ionomycin with Ca2+ indicates that ionomycin complexes and transports calcium ion in a one to one stoichiometry.

The induction of growth hormone synthesis and mRNA by thyroid hormone in cultured GH1 cells is mediated by the thyroid hormone nuclear receptor. In addition, the regulation of the growth hormone response by glucocorticoid is highly dependent on the action of thyroid hormone. To clarify whether thyroid hormone has a general influence on glucocorticoid action in GH1 cells, the glucocorticoid induction of growth hormone and glutamine synthetase was simultaneously examined. In contrast to the growth hormone response, the induction of glutamine synthetase by glucocorticoid was not influenced by thyroid hormone. Both responses appear to be modulated by the glucocorticoid receptor, and thyroid hormone had no influence on nuclear-associated glucocorticoid receptor levels. These results suggest that the thyroid hormone control of glucocorticoid induction of growth hormone may be a selective process, and the nuclear associated receptors for both thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones interrelate to control the growth hormone response.

Prolylcarboxypeptidase was purified from human kidney 1200-fold with 18% yield. The enzyme had no cathepsin A activity and appeared to be homogeneous in gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of prolylcarboxypeptidase was estimated to be 115,000 by gel filtration. Under denaturing conditions the enzyme dissociated into subunits of 45,000 and 66,500 molecular weight. The enzyme cleaved benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-Pro-Phe, representing the COOH-terminal end of angiotensin II and des-Asp1-angiotensin II (angiotensin III), at a rate of 31 micronmol/h/mg of protein. The rate of hydrolysis increased when phenylalanine in the N-protected dipeptide was replaced with alanine, valine, or leucine or when the octapeptide angiotensin II or the heptapeptide angiotensin III were the substrates. The enzyme also cleaved the angiotensin II antagonist saralasin (Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II). The Km values were 1 mM, 2mM, and 0.77 mM with Cbz-Pro-Phe, angiotensin II, and angiotensin III, respectively. The enzyme had an acid pH optimum (4.5 to 5.5), but hydrolyzed angiotensin III at pH 7 at 50% of the optimal rate. Prolylcarboxypeptidase was inhibited by diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate and pepstatin, but not by sequestering agents or -SH reagents.

In certain lines of hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells, glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) specific activity is increased 2.5- to 3-fold by the addition of glucocorticoids to the growth media. Actinomycin D blocks both the induction and deinduction of glutamine synthetase by glucocorticoids, suggesting a requirement of RNA synthesis for both processes. Using an antiserum raised against purified rat liver glutamine synthetase, we have precipitated radiolabeled glutamine synthetase from HTC cells. Electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates on sodium didecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels isolates the subunit of glutamine synthetase and permits the radioactivity in the glutamine synthetase band to be quantitated. Using this technique, we have investigated the effect of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, on the rates of synthesis and degradation of glutamine synthetase. Dexamethasone (10(-7) M) increases the rate of synthesis of glutamine synthetase 2- to 3-fold but has no effect on the rate of glutamine synthetase degradation. The rates of total cell protein synthesis and degradation are not significantly affected by dexamethasone. The presence of actinomycin D at the time of removal of dexamethasone from induced cells prevents the fall in the induced rate of synthesis of glutamine synthetase normally seen when the inhibitor is removed from the culture medium. The regulation of glutamine synthetase by dexamethasone has been compared to the regulation of another dexamethasone-inducible enzyme in HTC cells, tyrosine aminotransferase, and been found to be similar in all parameters studied.

Homogeneous wild type and feedback-resistant forms of the biosynthetic sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol-P) dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli (EC1.1.1.8) were subjected to two-substrate kinetic analysis. The kinetics of the NADPH-dependent reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dihydroxyacetone-P) and of the NADP-dependent oxidation of glycerol-P indicate that these reactions proceed by a sequential mechanism. Glycerol-P was a competitive inhibitor with respect to dihydroxyacetone-P for both enzymes. The wild type and feedback-resistant glycerol-P dehydrogenases had Ki values for glycerol-P of 4.4 micrometer and 43 micrometer, respectively. Therefore, the sensitivity of the wild type activity and reduced sensitivity of the feedback-resistant activity, both noted previously in crude extracts, were inherent properties of the enzymes. The patterns of product inhibition for both enzymes were identical, and the difference in the inhibition constants for glycerol-P occurred without significant alteration of any other kinetic constant determined. Kinetic mechanisms consistent with the patterns of product inhibition violated Haldane relationships and other kinetic relationships. These discrepancies suggest that glycerol-P inhibition occurs at a site distinct from the active site. The pH dependencies of the Km for dihydroxyacetone-P and the Ki for glycerol-P were markedly different suggesting the existence of an allosteric site. The addition of glycerol-P in the presence of NADPH stabilized both enzymes against thermal inactivation. Half-maximal stabilization was provided by 5 micrometer and 50 micrometer glycerol-P for the wild type and feedback-resistant enzymes, respectively. These kinetic data, considered in conjunction with previous physiologic and genetic data, indicate that the synthesis of glycerol-P is regulated in vivo by glycerol-P inhibition of the glycerol-P dehydrogenase. The data suggest that glycerol-P inhibition occurs at an allosteric, regulatory site.

About 1,300-fold purification of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase has been achieved from the extract of bovine thymus with a recovery of 10 to 20%. The final preparation has a purity of 99%, and the enzyme is composed of a single peptide with a molecular weight of 130,000. The purified enzyme required NAD+, Mg2+, a thiol compound, DNA, and histones for full activity. Whereas DNA is essential for activation of the enzyme, histones are not. The observed stimulation of the reaction by histones is shown to be due to masking of the inhibitory effect of contaminating denartured DNA in native DNA preparation. The concentration of DNA required for half-maximal enzyme activity (apparent Km for DNA) is proportional to the concentration of enzyme in the reaction mixture. The minimum estimation of the number of nucleotide pairs of DNA required for half-maximal activation of one enzyme molecule is 220 to 240 for bulk of calf thymus DNA, while the value is 10 for a calf thymus DNA fraction, "active DNA," which was separated from the enzyme fraction in a stage of the purification. These results suggest that the enzyme is activated by binding to a specific site on calf thymus DNA. The apparent Km for NAD+ and the maximum velocity of the enzyme are estimated to be 60 micrometer and 0.91 mumolper min per mg, respectively.

We have studied the destruction of purified muscle actin filaments by osmium tetroxide (OsO4) to develop methods to preserve actin filaments during preparation for electron microscopy. Actin filaments are fragmented during exposure to OsO4. This causes the viscosity of solutions of actin filaments to decrease, ultimately to zero, and provides a convenient quantitative assay to analyze the reaction. The rate of filament destruction is determined by the OsO4 concentration, temperature, buffer type and concentration, and pH. Filament destruction is minimized by treatment with a low concentration of OsO4 in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at 0 degrees C. Under these conditions, the viscosity of actin filament solutions is stable and actin filaments retain their straight, unbranched structure, even after dehydration and embedding. Under more severe conditions, the straight actin filaments are converted into what look like the microfilament networks commonly observed in cells fixed with OsO4. Destruction of actin filaments can be inhibited by binding tropomyosin to the actin. Cross-linking the actin molecules within a filament with glutaraldehyde does not prevent their destruction by OsO4. The viscosity decrease requires the continued presence of free OsO4. During the time of the viscosity change, OsO4 is reduced and the sulfur-containing amino acids of actin are oxidized, but little of the osmium is bound to the actin. Over a much longer time span, the actin molecules are split into discrete peptides.

Assessed the effect of response interference on the word associations of male and female process and reactive schizophrenics in two studies that used the difference in associative disturbances between high and low interference (low and high commonality stimulus words) as the measure. The reactives showed a significantly greater increase in disturbances in the high interference condition than did process schizophrenics in both studies. These results occurred in process and reactive groups that did not differ in age, IQ, institutionalization, and current level of physiological arousal and symptom severity in Study I. Findings supported predictions from a qualitative differences theory of cognitive deficit in schizophrenia.

Sixty-six coeds who reported fear of snakes on a paper-and-pencil fear inventory were exposed to a Physiological Response Test, during which their electrodermal and cardiac responses to a neutral stimulus and a caged snake were recorded. Half of these coeds then were exposed to a representative Behavioral Avoidance Test, on the basis of which they were classified as avoidant, as non-avoidant, or as neither. Those remaining were classified similarly with an Incentive Behavioral Avoidation Test, before which each was offered an incentive for displaying non-fearfulness. The electrodermal response data showed that students classifed as avoidant had not been more responsive to snake confrontation than the the students classified as non-avoidant. The cardiac response data showed that avoidant Ss had been relatively more responsive to the snake cue, but that differential responsiveness was not robust. These results held for both behavioral avoidance tests.

Administered the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test (AAT) to 54 students who expressed interest in participating in a test anxiety desensitization workshop. In addition, 182 students from the general college population were tested. Results indicated that both the debilitating and facilitating (AAT) scales were higher for the self-referred volunteer group. These data indicate that these scales are useful in distinguishing self-referred volunteers for behavior modification workshops from a general college population. In addition, the scales of the AAT were correlated with the number of sessions attended by those students who enrolled in the desensitization groups. Results indicated no relationship between attrition and debilitating anxiety. There was a correlation of r = .318 p less than .15 between facilitating anxiety scores and number of sessions attended. It is suggested that facilitating anxiety can function as a measure of S's ego strength in predicting workshop attendance.

Liquorice extracts and confections reduced enamel dissolution in acidic buffers and saliva/glucose incubations by a direct effect on solubility, and by inhibiting the fall in pH on incubation. These actions may be attributed to the solubility-reducing, glycolysis-inhibiting, and buffering properties of glycyrrhizinic acid, a constituent of liquorice.

In an attempt to make a dynamic study of the isoelectric point and the chargeability of human dental enamel, an electrochemical approach was utilized. Zeta potential of three kinds of the enamel was measured by a streaming potential method. As a result, these isoelectric points could be decided.

The pH values of xylitol-containing plaque suspensions of persons who habitually used xylitol and sorbitol during 3.2 to 4.5 years did not significantly differ from those observed with suspensions containing no added carbohydrates. Sorbitol produced in 22-hour incubations pH values as low as 3.9 to 5.5. The activity of plaque xylitol dehydrogenase was almost nil, whereas sorbitol dehydrogenase activity was higher. The nonacidogenic nature of xylitol in relation to plaque did not change in prolonged use of xylitol.

Rat oral mucosa microsomal delta4-3-ketosteroid-5alpha-A-ring reductase enzyme system, reducing testosterone and 4-androstenedione, was found to be inducible by systemic administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). MPA, when used in a mixture with testosterone and/or 4-androstenedione in vitro, acted as a competitive inhibitor of the reduction of these substrates.

Orofacial trauma was found in 49% of 260 documented cases of child abuse seen during of five-year period at the Children's Hospital Medical Center, Boston. An additional 16% of the cases involved head trauma; the total percentage of head and facial trauma was 65%. Head or facial trauma was the principal reason for admission to the hospital in 45% of the cases. A survey of 537 dentists in Massachusetts showed that the majority were unaware of their legal and social responsibilities to report suspected cases of child abuse. Eleven percent of all dentists surveyed saw orofacial trauma cases that were of a suspicious nature, by only 22 confirmed cases of child abuse were noted by the dentists. Of these, only four were reported to social agencies. In general, oral surgeons and pedodontists saw a higher percentage of these cases and were more aware of their responsibilities than were general practitioners.

The authors present a new instrument for measurement of actual instantaneous pH in obstetrics. It has been developped to avoid most errors of the usual scalp-blood sampling. Its advantages are:--Aspiration is manual and controlled.--Results are obtained within 10--15 seconds. A comparative study with two other pH-meters has demonstrated an excellent correlation and reliability of this new instrument. The authors consider the method as simple, functional and reliable, all favourable factors for routine use.

The association between polyarteritis and peripheral neuropathy may be overlooked in the clinical assessment of nerve lesions in the extremity. Nerve palsy may be the initial presenting complaint in polyarteritis nodosa. A case is presented which demonstrates the pathological process. A method for early recognition and treatment is suggested.

A lupus-like syndrome involving chronic urticaria with cutaneous vasculitis, systemic symptoms, hypocomplementemia with preferential depletion of C1q, and low m.w. (7S) C1q-precipitins has recently been defined. The C1q-precipitin activity (C1q-p) seems to represent a diagnostic marker of the disease, but its chemical nature is not yet clear. We have partially purified and characterized C1q-p from the serum of two patients with this syndrome and compared its activity with the C1q-precipitating activity of aggregated human gamma-globulin (AHGG) anti-C1q antibodies, and several polynucleotides including DNA and polyinosinic acid. C1q-p was found to partition with IgG during precipitation by ammonium sulfate and low ionic strength buffer as well as during column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and G-200 Sephadex. Like AHGG, but in complete contrast to the polynucleotides, the C1q-precipitating activity of C1q-p was sensitive to pepsin, trypsin, and acidic conditions, but unaffected by DNAse or RNAse; the C1q-precipitating activity of anti-C1q antibody was not diminished by any of these procedures. Thus, C1q-p consists of gamma-migrating protein of low m.w., and its C1q-precipitating activity is indistinguishable from that of AHGG. These results are consistent with the concept that C1q-p is comprised, at least in part, of IgG that binds C1q via the Fc portion of the molecule.

Human hairbulb tyrosinase from normally pigmented and tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous albino (TPA) hairbulbs was studied by single hairbulb and by pooled hairbulb assay procedures. The response to temperature and pH was the same for TPA and normal enzyme. The Km for tyrosine as substrate and the Km or dopa as cofactor was the same for TPA and normal enzyme. These studies show that TPA tyrosinase is kinetically normal and that the defect with this form of albinism must be elsewhere in the melanin pathway.

A reliable radioimmunoassay of endogenous angiotensin I concentration in plasma, extracted on a Dowex-resin at pH 7.4, is described. The concentration of angiotensin I in the pH 7.4-extracted plasma samples is significantly correlated with the angiotensin I concentration in the samples extracted at pH 5.5, the pH optimum of the in vitro reaction of human renin with human renin substrate. The presence of immunoreactive angiotensin I-like material in plasma and the relatively high cross-reaction of renin substrate with the anti-angiotensin I antiserum necessitates a chromatographic purification on a Dowex resin. The normal range found for angiotensin I in venous blood of apparently normal, male subjects was 25 to 143 pg/ml. A significant correlation (r = 0.78; p less than 0.001) between PA-I and PRA was found in normal subjects. No differences (p greater than 0.10) between arterial and venous angiotensin I concentration were observed in hypertensive patients.

In order to assess the possibility that treatment with the uricosuric diuretic ticrynafen (tienilic acid) could lead to UA or MSU crystalluria, the degree of urinary supersaturation with respect to these crystalloids was assessed in persons receiving the diuretic for 1 week, and the results were compared with similar data generated from the use of probenecid. Initially, only probenecid significantly increased the degree of urinary suspersaturation with respect to MSU, and after adjustment of urine pH values to 5.5, probenecid also increased the degree of urinary supersaturation with respect to nonionized UA. At a pH of 5.5, the urine was significantly more supersaturated with nonionized UA after a single dose of probenecid than after ticrynafen (tienilic acid). Ticrynafen never significantly affected the degree of urinary supersaturation with respect to UA or MSU. Neither agent affected small amounts of "colloidal" or "bound" urinary urate. Insofar as the degree of urinary supersaturation with these crystalloids predisposes to crystalluria and calculus formation, ticrynafen (tienilic acid) appears to present no increased risk.

Intra-arterial injection of a fixed acid load caused only a short-lived (less than 2h) disturbance of blood pH but a long lived (2-3 days) elevation of urinary acid excretion in freshwater trout (Salmo gairdneri). The renal response comprised an immediate increase in acid output in the form of titratable acidity minus bicarbonate, and a slower rise in acid output in the form of ammonia. The total elevation in urinary acid efflux over 72h was such that no other mechanism besides renal function is needed to explain the ultimate compensation of this experimental acid-base disturbance.

A bwamba group virus was isolated from the blood of a febrile child on the Kano Plain, Kenya. The isolate (NY-45), closely resembling Bwamba, established infection in both Anopheles gambiae and Mansonia uniformis. Neither the Bwamba nor the Pongola prototype strains grew in both species. In gel-diffusion tests NY-45 virus passaged through mosquitoes exhibited a line of identity with Pongola antiserum. In contrast no cross-reaction was observed with NY-45 virus which had not previously been passaged through mosquitoes.

Administration of a single dose (10 mg/kg) of a relatively new benzodiazepine, bromazepam to rats markedly suppressed their spontaneous locomotor activity. Hypomobility became apparent 15 min after the injection and remained significantly lower during the period of observation for 6 hours when locomotor activity was 27% of controls. Following 2 hours after bromazepam treatment, no change was noted in tyrosine levels and tyrosine hydroxylase activity in striatum or rate of catecholamine synthesis in synaptosomal preparation (P2 pellet). However, the endogenous levels of norepinephrine, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine were significantly increased not only in several brain areas examined, but also in P2 pellet. Bromazepam failed to change 3H-norepinephrine and 3H-5-hydroxytryptamine uptake in synaptosomes suggesting that the increased levels of monoamines are not related to laterations in uptake mechanisms, but probably to a diminished release. This is supported by the data on striatal homovanillic acid and whole brain 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl glycol whose concentrations were significantly lowered following a single injection of this benzodiazepine. However, bromazepam increased 5-hydroxyindole-acetic acid levels in hypothalamus, mid-brain and pons-medulla. The present study demonstrates that bromazepam elicits its tranquilizing action by lowering the release of catecholamines in brain; however, its anti-anxiety action might be associated with a reduction in 5-hydroxytryptamine turn over. Our data also suggest that bromazepam is almost as potent as diazepam in altering the metabolism of certain putative neurotransmitters in brain.

The biosynthesis and processing of low molecular weight protein (presumed neurosecretory protein) in cells R15, R14 and L11 of Aplysia californica was studied at high resolution by polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecylsulfate. The number of low molecular weight proteins detected in each cell ranges from 3 in R14 and L11 to 5 to 6 in R15. In each of the cells studied, the low molecular weight protein consists of a primary precursor of ca. 12,000 daltons, and its proteolytic processing products. In each cell, the smallest protein, or in the case of R14, one of the two smallest proteins, accumulates to a significant extent, suggesting that it might correspond to a final processed neurohormone. In cell R15, the biosynthesis of the primary precursor and its subsequent processing to smaller peptides is largely unaffected by removal of extracellular calcium, by replacement of calcium with cobalt or by inhibition of spontaneous bursting via stimulation of the brachial nerve.

In a study of oesophageal motility in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease, intravenous atropine produced marked disruption of co-ordination in response to swallows, when compared with control subjects. This suggests that cholinergic rather than dopaminergic mechanisms are more important in the control of swallowing in patients with Parkinsonism. No conclusive evidence of peripheral dopamine depletion or autonomic neuropathy was found, although minor changes suggestive of the former were found in severely affected patients.

Four new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents carrying tyramine as the amino moiety were synthesized and the distribution of their I-125-tagged derivatives evaluated in rats. This distribution was compared with the distribution of various agonists and antagonists labeled with H-3 and C-14, and with the in vitro binding affinity of the new derivatives. A radioiodinated derivative of a cardioselective blocker, alprenolol, showed poor blood clearance and no cardiac selectivity. A derivative of another cardioselective blocker, practolol, showed a promising heart-to-blood ratio (ca. 19) and cardioselectivity with a heart-to-lung ratio of ca. 2. Two additional practolol analogs showed no improvement over the practolol derivative; because of the increased lipophilicity of these derivatives, blood clearance and cardioselectivity were diminished. An inverse correlation is suggested between the dissociation constant for the beta adrenoceptor in the lung and the heart-to-blood and heart-to-lung values. We conclude that polarity plays an important role in the blood clearance and cardioselectivity of these beta-adrenoceptor derivatives.

The effects of experimental infections with Fasciola hepatica of ovine and bovine origin in homologous and heterologous hosts and in uninfected controls were compared; groups comprised 5 animals each. The effects of the infections were monitored by biweekly determinations of packed cell volumes (PCV), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), serum iron, bilirubin levels, alkaline phosphatase (AlP) and total serum protein levels. Infected animals showed changes in SGOT, SGPT and GGT activity levels, and GGT activity levels, and infected lambs showed changes in PCV and AlP. However, no no significant differences in these serum levels between infected host groups were attributable to fluke strain. At necropsy, calves infected with ovine and bovine strains on an average had about the same number of flukes, but lambs infected with a high dose of the bovine strain on the average had nearly twice the number of flukes as those infected with ovine strain. Weight gains did not differ within host groups; liver damage was extensive in all infected animals. On the basis of these experiments, the pathogenicity of the ovine and the bovine strains of F. hepatica appears to be the same.

The tissues of female Ascaris suum were assayed for alpha,apha'-glucoside 1-D-glucohydrolase (trehalase) activity. A soluble from of the enzyme was isolated from muscle tissue and purified approximately 37-fold. The enzyme was specific for trehalose as substrate. The pH optimum for enzymatic activity was found to be 6.0, and the apparent Km for trehalose was estimated to be 2.1 x 10-4 M. The product of the reaction was identified as D-glucose by chemical, chromatographic and enzymatic methods.

The interaction of the four most commonly used preservatives in contact lens solutions (chlorbutol, thiomersal, chlorhexidine gluconate and benzalkonium chloride) with polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (polyHEMA), has been examined. Benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate show typical high affinity type isotherms. The interaction of benzalkonium chloride with polyHEMA from aqueous solution was reversible whereas that of chlorhexidine was only reversible in the presence of electrolyte or surfactant. Chlorbutol showed a typical reversible linear isotherm. Thiomersal does not interact with polyHEMA above pH 5.0. The extent of chlorhexidine--polyHEMA interactions in increased by the presence of formulatory adjuvants such as electrolyte and hydrophilic polymers. PolyHEMA lenses that apparently have been equilibrated with chlorhexidine gluconate will, on the addition of fresh preservative solution, bind further quantities of chlorhexidine above that which would be predicted from the sorption isotherm.

The theory is outlined of a procedure for characterizing the time-course of drug absorption by determining the mean absorption time. The procedure requires data of the type normally collected in bioavailability studies.

The in vivo availability of griseofulvin from a novel formulation has been compared with the micronized powder. The formulation technique involves the conversion of the hydrophobic surface of the drug to a hydrophilic one by treatment with a film forming polymer. This enhances the wettability of the power, and increases its dissolution rate. The results of the in vivo study show the formulation technique has increased the rate and extent of bioavailability of griseofulvin when compared with the non-treated powder.

The recently developed topological index, molecular connectivity (chi), has been correlated using multiple regression analysis with gas chromatographic retention time (Rt) for various series of compounds. For saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, and aliphatic aldehydes, good correlation with log Rt was achieved by one-parameter linear equations in terms of the first-order conncectivity index. (1chi). The equation for aliphatic alcohols required an additional parameter, the valence connectivity (vchi) for satisfactory correlation. One-parameter equations using 1chi also good correlation with log Rt for three series of drug molecules, amphetamines, barbiturates and phenothiazines. In all cases the equations generated gave good agreement between calculated and observed log Rt values.

The effect of temperature on the permeation of phenolic compounds from aqueous solution through excised human skin has been examined. From a thermodynamic analysis of the data, a mechanism is postulated by which these solutes penetrate through human skin. For the more polar solutes it is suggested that the main resistance to penetration is the lipid barriers in the stratum corneum. Diffusion of these substances through the stratum corneum appears to depend on the breaking of hydrogen bonds in the desolvation of the solute during this penetration process and by the overall 'viscosity' of the stratum corneum. With non-polar solutes, the aqueous boundary layers appear to provide an additional barrier to the penetration of phenolic compounds.

Polyphloretin phosphate (PPP) produced a dose-dependent decrease in the tone and reduction of the spontaneous phasic contactions of the longitudinal muscle of guinea-pig isolated ileum. PPP (100 microgram ml-1) after a 2 min contact with the ileum decreased the contractile effects of PGE1 0.1 micron by 40.6 +/- 7.4%, of PGE1 0.01 micron by 86.7 +/- 3.3% and of PGE2alpha 0.1 micron by 62.2 +/- 8.6%. After 10 min contact of PPP the contractile effect of PGE1 0.1 micron was decreased by 47.7 +/- 4.7% and that of PGE2alpha 0.1 micron by 89.6 +/- 1.7%. When the contact was longer, PPP showed a pronounced after-effect in respect to the effects of PGE1 and particularly of PGF2alpha. PPP signicantly reduced contractions to 5-HT and BaCL2, but not to acetylcholine, histamine or substance P. The type of antagonism of PGE1 by PPP was examined using cumulative concentration-effect curves for PGE1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of PPP. We conclude that on guinea-pig ileum PPP acts as a non-competitive antagonist of PGE1 and PGF2alpha.

A study was made of the effects of nomifensine, 4'-hydroxynomifensine and 3',4'-dihydroxynomifensine on dopamine receptors in rat striatum and nucleus accumbens, using the dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase assay. Nomifensine and its 4'-hydroxy metabolite were both inactive as dopaminergic agonists. 3',4'-dihydroxynomifensine was, however, a potent agonist, being approximately 2 to 4 times less active than dopamine. The effects of dopamine and of 3',4'-dihydroxynomifensine were blocked by fluphenazine. It is concluded that the dopaminergic activity of 3',4'-dihydroxynomifensine is dependent upon the presence of the two hydroxyl groups.

Systemic and regional haemodynamic variables were measured at the baseline and after saline or 5-HT infusions (5 microgram kg-1 min-1, i.v.) or methysergide injections (0.5 mg kg-1, i.v.). Cardiac output and its complete distribution were measured by the radioactive microsphere (15 micrometer diam) technique. Although 5-HT did not change the systemic variables, methysergide caused a moderate increase in systolic and mean blood pressure and heart rate. 5-HT caused a substantial increase in gastric and a moderate increase in cerebral and myocardial blood flow at the expense of that to the lungs (arteriovenous shunt + bronchial flows), kidneys and skin. While methysergide was able to reduce the vascular responses to 5-HT in stomach, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs and brain, the drug itself, like 5-HT, decreased the number of microspheres reaching the lungs. Since a large number of 15 micron microspheres can escape through the arteriovenous anastomoses to lodge in the lungs it seems likely that both 5-HT and methysergide can reduce the 'non-nutrient' flow through these anastomoses.

6,7-Dihydroxy-2-dimethylaminotetralin (TL-99), the 5,6-dihydroxy isomer (M-7) and dopamine were studied for cardiovascular activity in the cat and dog. TL-99 was found to be the most active of these compounds. Some of the more striking actions of TL-99 and M-7 were bradycardia, hypotension and complete blockade of norepinephrine-induced reflex activation. A detailed study of these compounds showed that they were most likely exerting their effects by inhibiting sympathetic nervous system activity. Whether these compounds were activating dopamine receptors or alpha adrenergic receptors is not entirely clear from this study.

The influence of the dosage or duration of treatment on the incidence and severity of clonidine withdrawal responses was examined in normotensive rats. Clonidine (0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg i.m.) was administered either in single doses, or twice daily for 3 days or 3 weeks. Rats were then anesthetized and arterial catheters were inserted. Significant overshoots in blood pressure and heart rate, reaching peak values 16 to 26 hr after the last injection, occurred in all clonidine-treated rats, but in no control rats. The overshoots after single injections of clonidine were as great as those after suspension of sustained treatment. Moreover, withdrawal responses were as great after the low dose as they were after the 10-fold greater dose. Only plasma renin activity showed a significantly greater elevation during withdrawal of the high dose of clonidine. Since ganglionic blockade reduced blood pressures and heart rates to the same levels in rats with clonidine withdrawal hypertension as in control rats, the withdrawal overshoots appear to be nervously mediated. Neither the dosage nor the duration of treatment could be shown to determine the magnitude of the response to withdrawal of clonidine.

This is a report on a study of the social origins, attitudes, and anticipated practice settings of black and white recruits to the physician's assistant occupation. Recruits are generally representative of the larger black and white communities in their values; however, black recruits are more likely than their white counterparts to value the status, income, and stability perceived to be associated with the occupation. At the same time, blacks are more likely to favor national health insurance and to look forward to servicing the poor. These liberal social attitudes and the finding that blacks are more likely than whites to desire to practice in ghetto areas provide some support for affirmative action policies in dealing with the health manpower needs of medically underserviced areas.

The presence of suppressor cells in the spleens of C57BL/6 mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma was investigated with the use of the in vitro lymphoproliferative response to mitogens and the graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) as test systems. Splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice showed a lower response to mitogens when obtained 15-27 days after tumor transplant. In parallel, these cells were capable of suppressing the response of normal spleen cells to mitogens and their capacity to mount a GVHR in allogeneic hosts. Treatments with procedures known to remove adherent phagocytes, but not treatments with anti-Thy 1.2 serum plus complement, removed the suppressive activity observed.

A new approach was developed by which freshly isolated, chemical carcinogen-altered hepatocytes with the positive marker gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) could be transferred from adult donor F344 rats to the livers of syngeneic, adult host rats. Selective proliferation of gamma-GT-positive hepatocytes was induced in host rat livers, such that large, macroscopic colonies of altered hepatocytes could be generated within 10 days of the cell transfer operation. Quantitation of the number of gamma-GT-positive hepatocyte colonies (foci) appearing per square centimeter of host liver section area on day 10 following cell transfer revealed that prior treatment of host rats with a low dose of 2-acetylaminofluorene was essential for the appearance of large numbers of foci. In addition, the appearance of foci on day 10 depended on the presence of intact, gamma-GT-positive hepatocytes in the infused (transferred) cell suspensions.

The prune belly syndrome consists of a triad of abdominal wall musculature deficiency, cryptorchidism and urinary tract anomalies. A rarely described but fairly constant component of the syndrome is the lack of development of the epithelial elements of the prostate. We wish to suggest that this is a further expression of a postulated arrest in mesenchymal development responsible for other features of the syndrome.

Fifty-seven patients with end-stage acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) received a total of 65 bone marrow transplants between 1968 and 1976. Marrow from HLA genotypically identical allogeneic donors was administered to 32 patients, 13 received marrow from HLA-incompatible donors, donor-recipient HLA compatibility was undetermined for eight patients, and identical twins were marrow donors for four patients. None of the patients  in the three latter groups survived beyond 9.4 months after transplantation. Two patients treated with marrow transplants from HLA-compatible donors currently are alive and free of leukemia with functioning grafts 13 and 38 months after transplantation. The 32 patients in the Registry series who received marrow from HLA-compatible donors were compared with a similar series of 46 patients in Seattle. Data for these 78 patients were pooled and analyzed for pretransplant factors that might have prognostic value. Patients with end-stage AML had approximately a 10% chance of surviving 20 months after high-dose chemoradiotherapy plus marrow transplantation. Patients younger than 21 years had a higher six-month survival rate than patients older than 30 years. Patients in the Registry series who received transplants with HLA-compatible marrow within eight months of diagnosis had a higher survival experience than patients who received transplants later.

A glass cage with minimal surface area was designed and used to house mice for 24-hour urine collections. An experiment was performed with a radio-labeled compound excreted in the urine to assess the collection efficiency of the cage. In this experiment 74.2 +/- 6.5% of the excreted radioactivity was recovered in the urine, with 25.8 +/- 6.5% found adhering to the cage surfaces. When a flow-through pH electrode, meter, and recorder were attached, the system provided a continuous pH versus time urination record.

Sixteen hour polygraphic recordings (EEG, EOG and EMG) were obtained from 14 adult cats after intraperitoneal injections of propranolol (5 mg/kg) or pindolol (0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg). All injections moderately increased waking, which consisted mainly of a sedated drowsy stage. Both drugs also decreased deep slow wave sleep, while light slow wave sleep remained at control levels. The changes were more marked after propranolol, which also significantly reduced paradoxical sleep (PS). The decrease in the deeper stages of sleep and PS is suggested as being due to blockade of the central adrenergic beta-receptors per se and/or antagonistic effects of the beta-blockers on 5-HT receptors. The results agree with the finding that beta-blockers cause insomnia in susceptible patients, but they do not suggest that intensified dreaming or nightmares reported by others are likely to be caused by increased PS.

The greatest part of all diseases of salivary glands are caused by inflammations. The differential diagnosis to other diseases, e.g. tumors, if of great importance. The sialography has hereby developed to an important diagnostic measurement. There is a discussion about the technique of the sialography and its simple performance as well as the high effectiveness of this X-ray examination. The X-ray morphology of different kinds of inflammations is various. The acute inflammations are characterized by narrowing of ducts, the subacute inflammations by the pathological staining of the parenchyma, and the chronic by the increased changes of the Stenon's or Wharton's duct, respectively of ducts with superior range.

Five different disorders of motility of the pyloric region may be distinguished if direction and velocity of chyme passing through the pylorus are taken into account: 1. Accelerated emptying of food and overacidification of the bulbus duodeni: 2. Bolus emptying of the stomach and rapid increasing hyperosmolarity in the small intestine: 3. Delayed emptying of the stomach and gastric retention: 4. Duodeno-gastric reflux and inflammatory lesions of the gastric mucosa: 5. Other disorders causing pain. Gastric disroders cannot yet be classified on the basis of abnormal motility patterns. It is well known, that the gastric and duodenal motility are regulated by two separate pacemakers located in the distal corpus area and in the bulbus duodeni. Thus it may be speculated that distrubed motility patterns may be due to abnormal pacemaker function.

The effect of anions Cl- and I- on structural and kinetic properties of LDH was investigated. It was shown that anions are specific inhibitors of LDH competing with pyruvate in the active ternary complex, LDHNADHpyq. The following dissociation constants for the anions were obtained from inhibition data: 0.4 +/- 0.02 and 0.07 +/- 0.01 M for Cl- and I-, respectively. The slope of Hill plot are near 1.0. The anions abolished the inhibition of LDH at high pyruvate concentrations. The following dissociation constants were obtained from these data: 0.1 and 0.015 M for Cl- and I- respectively. The inhibition by anions and the abolishing of substrate inhibition by anions were studied also for the lactate oxidation reaction. The dissociation constants for anions obtained from these data are in good correlation with the constants obtained for the pyruvate reduction reaction. It was concluded that anions do not interact with the group at the catalytic site with pK approximately 7.8, presumably His-195. The degree of pyruvate inhibition does not depend on the buffer system. The differences in the degree of inhibition obtained previously in phosphate, imidazole and tris-buffer systems can be explained by the presence of Cl- anions in the last two buffer. The rate constants of hydroxy leads to keto pyruvate transition was obtained in various buffer systems. It was shown that the hydroxy-form of pyruvate does not cause the inhibition of LDH.

Comparison of two compounds being investigated should take into consideration the most comprehensive spectrum of all psychic variables affected. Consequently, besides 15 standardized investigational methods, three open methods, history, observation of behavior and in particular free exploration were used. The investigation was carried out in 18 ambulant patients who were given the preparations under investigation in a double-blind cross-over trial. Particular problems of the method were the interference of psychotherapeutic effect of the intensive exploration discussions on the action of the preparations, which could be controlled by comparison with a placebo phase, and the effects of learning and stereotype on repeated presentation.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) capable of coding hydrocortisone induced isoenzyme of tyrosineaminotransferase (TAT) was isolated and purified approximately 5000 times. Highly specific rabbit antibodies to the isoenzyme were obtained. Using these antibodies a specific antibody immunoadsorbent with a high capacity for specific binding to TAT was prepared. From total rat liver polyribosomes induced by hydrocortisone a specific fraction synthesising TAT was isolated by fractionation on the antibody immunoadsorbent. Affinity chromatography using poly(U)--Sephadex 4B allowed to isolate a poly(A)-containing RNA from this polyribosome fraction. The mRNA (15-16S) acts as a matrix in a cell-free protein synthesising system. The extent of purification of the mRNA was estimated by the synthesis of specific protein TAT in the cell-free system.

The influence of denaturation conditions upon the character of partial denaturation of DNA with random base distribution were thoroughly studied. Maps of partial DNA denaturation were obtained at T less than TAT for phage phiB DNA at pH 10.7 and 5.5; Tg9 DNA at pH 8.8; at T less than TAT for phiB DNA at pH 10.9 and Tg9 DNA at pH 8.8. The map quality was better when obtained at higher pH values; the peaks became sharper and higher against the background. We failed to obtain maps of partial denaturation at pH 5.5, T less than TAT. The improvement of the map quality and existence of the partial denaturation maps at T less than TAT at pH 10.9 were explained by the increase of primary melting probability of AT-rich DNA regions. At high pH the denaturation map quality was temperature independent. This was explained by a very weak temperature dependence of primary melting probability for all maps of equal quality. The map quality became worse, when the quantity of loops was increased.

Potentiometric titration of DNA in the isoionic solutions has been investigated at different concentrations of the polymer. The intrinsic constants pKo of titrable groups corresponding to the two inflections in the titration curves were calculated by taking into account the electrostatic potential of the macroion. The number of ionogenic groups was evaluated from curves of titration. It has been found that the constants of ionization of both ionogenic groups increased with DNA concentration. The number of ionogenic groups corresponding to the first inflection in titration curves is significantly decreased when the concentration of DNA increases. On the other hand, the number of groups corresponding to the second inflection is slightly increased. Spectrophotometric investigations of isoionic solutions of DNA showed that the molar extinction coefficient increases with the concentration of the polymer. The results are discussed in view of the change of the secondary structure of DNA caused by an increase of its concentration in isoionic solutions.

To determine if a normal antibody response can develop after therapy for Hodgkin's disease, we immunized 53 patients and 10 normal controls with dodecavalent pneumococcal vaccine. Antibody concentrations three weeks after immunization (geometric mean of 11 serotypes) were 1566 ng of protein nitrogen per milliliter in controls, 963 ng per milliliter after subtotal radiation (P less than 0.05 compared to controls), 658 ng per milliliter after chemotherapy (P less than 0.05), 377 ng per milliliter after subtotal radiation plus chemotherapy (P less than 0.01) and 283 ng per milliliter after total nodal radiation plus chemotherapy (P less 0.001). Low levels of antibody before immunization correlated with a poor response (r = +0.73, P less than 0.001). The ability to respond to immunization improved significantly but did not return to normal as long as four years after combined therapy. The antibody response to pneumococcal vaccine is profoundly impaired in patients who have received intensive treatment for Hodgkin's disease: the ability of this vaccine to protect them from overwhelming postsplenectomy infections remains in doubt.

Dissociation of ionizing groups in leghemoglobin from Lupinus Luteus in the wide pH range was studied by potentiometric titration. 16 + 8 groups were shown to the titrated at acid pH. One part of them are normally titrating groups and the other one is associated with some details of protein structure. At neutral pH 4 groups are titrated, the titration of 3 of the show histeresis. Five lysins are normally titrated at the alkaline pH. among them one is possibly responsible for an alkaline dissociation. 13 charged groups take part in the dissociation, 3-4 are titrated inreversibly. The experimental results are analyzed in terms of Linderstrom-Lang-Tanford representation and are discussed on the basis of primary and three-dimentional leghemoglobin structure.

The effects of phenylephrine on the shape of the contraction curve and on the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (c-AMP) content were studied in electrically driven (frequency 0.2 Hz) cat papillary muscles. All experiments were done in the presence of 1 micron propranolol in order to minimize interference from beta-adrenoceptors. 1. Phenylephrine increased the force of contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal effects (about 200% of control) occurred at 30 micron phenylephrine. 2. The positive inotropic effect (PIE) of phenylephrine was antagonized by phentolamine. Phentolamine, 5 micron, produced a parallel shift of the concentration-response curve for the PIE of phenylephrine by about two log units to the right. 3. The PIE of 30 micron phenylephrine occurred without any detectable increase in the c-AMP levels of the preparations. 4. The PIE of 30 micron phenylephrine developed about three times more slowly than the PIE of an equieffective concentration of isoprenaline. 5. The PIE of phenylephrine was accompanied by significant, concentration-dependent increases in both time to peak force and relaxation time. 6. It is concluded that the PIE of phenylephrine in the presence of propranolol is mediated mainly by a stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors. It is unlikely to be related to an increase in c-AMP. With respect to time course and influence on the shape of the contraction curve it is qualitatively different from the effects of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. These data are taken to support the hypothesis that the mechanical effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulating agents on the heart are produced by different mechanisms.

gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase was purified 600-fold from Morris hepatoma 5123D by six-step procedure. Its apparent molecular weight estimated by centrifugation in sucrose gradient with Triton X-100 amounts to 108 000. Some dipeptides particularly glycylglycine and several amino acids considerably increase the enzyme activity but L-serine with borate decreases it. Usually transfer activity of the enzyme towards gamma-L-glutamyl substrates was much higher than hydrolytic. The best substrate for the hepatoma enzyme is reduced glutathione.

The activity, properties, and developmental pattern of cysteine sulfinate transaminase (CSA-T) were studied in chick retina and compared with the activity, properties, and developmental pattern of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT). Their optimum pH is identical whereas the effect of pyridoxal phosphate seems to be different. Developmental patterns are also different. The Km and Vm of CSA-T and GOT were determined in chick retina homogenate. These results suggest that two different enzymes are responsible for the transamination of cysteine sulfinate (CSA) and aspartate.

In a continuing study of the physiological role of protein breakdown in the hypothalamus, acid proteinase from bovine hypothalamus was purified about 1000-fold. The molecular weight of the enzyme was approximately 50,000. Masimal activity against hemoglobin was obtained at pH 3.2-3.5; serum albumin was split much more slowly. Hypothalamus acid proteinase was partially inhibited by beta-phenyl pyruvate, or benzethonium Cl, and was completely inhibited by low concentrations of pepstatin. This proteinase splits somatostatin, substance P, and analogs of substance P. The probable sites of enzyme action on these peptides were determined by the end group dansyl technique. The enzyme, most likely cathepsin D, may play an important role in the formation and breakdown of peptide hormones in the hypothalamus.

Oxytocin, elevated estrogen-progesterone ratio, fetal corticosteroids, prostaglandins, catecholamines, and changes in uterine blood flow have all been implicated as triggers of labor. In approximately one-third of cases of threatened premature labor contractions stop spontaneously. Thus placebo-controlled randomized trials of any new drug for inhibition of premature labor are necessary, as the spontaneous cessation of contractions always favors the claimed therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol inhibits the release of endogenous oxytocin and has an additional direct effect on the myometrium. In one study alcohol was more effective than placebo in the postponement of delivery. Isoxsuprine, ritodrine, and terbutaline have also been shown to be better than placebo in the inhibition of premature labor, and the beta adrenergic agents appear to be more effective than alcohol. Prostaglandin inhibitors such as indomethacin are currently under investigation. Success is correlated with early administration of the therapy, which requires treating some patients whose contractions might have stopped spontaneoulsy. As different factors may be involved in triggering premature labor, if one therapeutic approach fails another should be initiated promptly.

Forty-two percent of collagen sponges tested as an intravaginal barrier contraceptive method developed malodor when retained for 5 days. Only 4% developed odor when the sponge was removed within 24 hours after intercourse, rinsed, and reinserted. While sexually active volunteers found odor in 37% of the sponges, odor formed only in 4% of the sponges worn by sexually inactive users. No difference in the rate of odor formation was found when neutral pH (7.0) and acid pH (3.4) collagen sponges were tested, although we believe that a pH 3.4 is too acid and promotes odor formation. The optimal pH of the sponge should be 4.5 to 5.5. Malodor was efficiently extracted from sponges by washing in acid milieu of tap water and vinegar or 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Alkali extraction procedures were ineffective, and lukewarm water was slightly less effective than acid extraction of odor. At the time of malodor development, the high content of polyamines (putrescine, spermine, spermidine) in the ejaculate decreased to undetectable values. We conclude that the ejaculate is the major source of malodor formation in intravaginally worn collagen sponges. Removal, rinsing optimally in vinegar solution, and reinsertion within 24 hours after intercourse reduces the chance of malodor formation.

Use of the endodontic implant stabilizer presents a sound physiologic procedure for stabilizing mobile teeth. It can increase root length, alter rootcrown ratios, immobilize fractured roots and periodontally compromised teeth, or supply combinations of these benefits. Case selection, operative technique, and case reports with follow-up are presented in order to demonstrate uses and versatility.

The usefulness of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity (gammaGT) was studied in 39 patients on whom a bromsulphthalein retention test (BSP) was performed. In most patients, the potentially hazardous BSP test did not give any further evidence of hepatic disease over conventional hepatic function tests and the gammaGT.

From January 1970 to December 1976, 867 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from clinical specimens were routinely typed and tested for sensitivity to 12 antibiotics. The prevalent serotypes were 19, 23, 6, 3, 7 and 14. Twenty seven p. cent of the strains were found resistant to tetracycline, and 4,2% were resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Two strains were resistant to erythromycin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin G, cephalotin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, minocycline and erythromycin were determined by the agar dilution method on 80 strains. The incidence of tetracycline resistant strains increased from 10% to 40%. These strains were less susceptible to minocycline when tested in vitro and they were clinically resistant. Chloramphenicol resistant strains are isolated since 1972 and represented in 1976 more than 6% of the isolates. They belong to 14 different serotypes. We have previously reported that resistance to chloramphenicol is due to a chloramphenicol-acetyl-transferase which is probably plasmid mediated. The epidemiological and clinical implications of these results are discussed.

Guanylate cyclase, cGMP phosphodiesterase and protein kinase activities were determined in kidneys of developing and adult rats. Guanylate cyclase activities of crude kidney homogenates, 100,000 x g supernatant and pellet of 7- and 21-day-old and adult rats were determined (Table I). In the kidneys of 7-day-old rats activity was 162% of adult controls in the homogenates (P less than .001), 144% in the soluble (P less than .005) and 308% in the particulate fraction (P less than .001). In 3-week-old rats activity was still significantly higher at 144% in the homogenate (P less than 0.02) and at 225% in the particulate (P less than .001). Phosphodiesterase activity for cGMP was 7488 +/- 831 pmol cGMP/mg protein . min in 1-week-old and 7674 +/- 1120 in 3-week-old rats vs. 4042 +/- 122 in the adults (P less than .025) (Table II). Chromatography on Sephadex G-200 showed two peaks of cGMP-stimulatable protein kinase in both the adult and newborn kidney and in addition a minor peak of cGMP-stimulatable kinase in the newborn kidny only (Fig. 2).

A child with a poorly differentiated lymphoma developed varicella while being treated with maintenance chemotherapeutic agents. He received a transfusion of nonirradiated leukocytes from 1 unit of whole blood donated by a healthy volunteer who had recently recovered from varicella. The clinical course of varicella was aborted, but a classic graft-versus-host reaction developed and ultimately proved fatal. The host may have presented a large population of antigen-bearing cells to an infusion of presensitized immunocompetent donor cells, leading to an overwhelming aggressor lymphocyte reaction. We speculate that a modified approach using irradiated donor cells could be of benefit in the treatment of varicella infections in the immunosuppressed host.

In cats the perivascular space of small pial arteries was perfused with mock CSF by means of micropipettes. Variations of K+, H+ and Ca++ activities in the perfusate cause changes of the diameters of the affected vessels. Increases of H+ and moderate increases of K+ lead to dilatations, Ca++ -increases elicit constrictions. The ions interact in such a way that perivascular Ca++ inhibits the K+ or H+ induced dilator response of the pial arteries. Alkalosis intensifies the constrictor action of Ca++. Perivascular microperfusion with Ca++ -free mock CSF causes dilatation which can be augmented by additional acidosis (pH 6.5). However, an increase of K+ to 10.8-10(-3) mol.1(-1) (4 times normal) does not change the diameters of the vessels already dilated, thus indicating differences in the action of K+ and H+ upon the membranes of the pial vascular smooth muscle cells. Small vessels (less than 80 micron diameter) respond with a significantly stronger dilatation when Ca++ is complexed with EGTA as compared with vessels of more than 80 micron diameter.

Luminal pH in early and late proximal tubules was recorded continuously with antimony microelectrodes before and during carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Following i.v. application of benzolamide (25 mumol/kg BW), luminal pH decreased almost immediately in early proximal tubules (deltapH--0.42 +/- 0.06SEM), but increased in late proximal tubules (deltapH +0.27 +/- 0.06). Urinary pH increased (deltapH + 1.6 +/- 0.16) after a delay of some 30 s. Similar results, i.e. decrease of pH in early and increase of pH in late proximal tubules, were obtained, when benzolamide containing solutions were microinfused into early proximal tubules or superfused on the nephron surface. In contrast, luminal pH decreased in late proximal tubules, when benzolamide was microinfused into the same nephron segment. The decrease of luminal pH indicates inhibition of luminally active carbonic anhydrase, leading to delayed buffering  of secreted hydrogen ions. The increase of luminal pH in late proximal tubules may be attributed to several factors including increased delivery of bicarbonate, impaired bicarbonate exit at the antiluminal membrane and decreased hydrogen ion formation in the tubular cell due to inhibition of cellular carbonic anhydrase.

Both 4,6-dimethyl-2-thipyrimidine and its 1-methyl derivative undergo polarographic reduction in aqueous medium, via a 1e/1H+ reduction to a free radical which rapidly dimerizes to products isolates and identified as 4,4'-bis-(4,6-dimethyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2-thione) and the corresponding 1-methyl dimer. The dimers may be oxidized electrolytically to regenerate the parent monomers. Both dimers also undergo photodissociation to quantitatively regenerate the parent monomers, in high quantum yield, 0.23 and 0.35 M/Einstein. The correlation between electrochemical and photochemical reductions of 2-thiopyrimidines are discussed, as well as the significance of the dimer photodissociation reactions in relation to nucleic acid photochemistry.

Cosmetically satisfactory scars were achieved in 94.5% of skin crease orchidopexy wounds sutured with subcuticular polyglycolic acid. Of twenty-seven similar wounds closed with interrupted black silk sutures 18.5% developed hypertrophy at the medial end.

To investigate the chemical relationships between rat liver lysosomal and microsomal beta-D-glucuronidases (EC 3.2.1.31), which are essentially identical catalytically and in reactivity with antibody and similar in molecular weight, the two enzymes were isolated by procedures in which modifications of the proteins were avoided. The purified enzymes were found to differ in both sugar and amino acid compositions. The microsomal enzyme contained much more mannose and, in contrast to the lysosomal enzyme, contained sialic acid but no glucose. Moreover, although the amino acid compositions generally agreed closely, the microsomal enzyme contained much more serine and somewhat less arginine than the lysosomal form. These findings of specific differences in composition should have a bearing on the consideration of intracellular glycoprotein synthesis, translocation, and compartmentalization.

Folate binding activity of high affinity was identified in the particulate fractions of rat kidney homogenates. This binding activity cofractionated with alkaline phosphatase and maltase, two brush border membranes markers. With an enriched preparation of brush border membranes, freed of endogenous folate by acid treatment, the binding of [3H]olate was found to be saturable (Kb = 4.2 X 10(-11)M) and rapid. Binding was optimal at pH 6.4-7.7. At neutral pH, competition for binding with [3H]folic acid required 1.45 equivalents of pteroylheptaglutamate, 6.25 equivalents of N5-methyltetrathydrofolate, 29 equivalents of methotrexate, and 125 equivalents of N5-formyltetrahydrofolate. At alkaline pH, N5-methyltetrahydrofolate was as effective a competitor as folic acid. In view of reports that renal tubular reabsorption of folate includes an initial tight binding step, the binding activity associated with the brush border membranes may participate in this process.

The interconversion of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase [L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6.3.1.2] between its adenylylated and unadenylylated forms has been used to verify the prediction derived from a theoretical analysis of the steady-state functions of a model for a monocyclic interconvertible enzyme cascade system [Stadtman, E. R. & Chock, P. B. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 2761-2770]. Because glutamine and alpha-ketoglutarate are multifunctional effectors and because three active enzyme complexes are involved in both adenylylation and deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase, at least 28 constants are required to describe the glutamine synthetase monocyclic cascade. Of these, 22 constants were determined experimentally and 6 were estimated via computer curve fitting. Despite the complexity, when both adenylylation and deadenylylation reactions are functioning, the number of adenylyl groups bound per mole of enzyme, n, assumes a steady-state level as is predicted by the model. This n value is determined by the mole fraction of P(IIA)-given by ([P(IIA)]/([P(IIA)] + [P(IID)])-and the ratio of glutamine to alpha-ketoglutarate (P(IID) and P(IID) are the unmodified and the uridylylated forms of the P(II) regulatory protein). In the presence of 0.5 mM glutamine and 2 mM alpha-ketoglutarate, the value of n increases as a nearly hyperbolic function in response to increasing mole fractions of P(IIA). When the constant level of alpha-ketoglutarate is gradually increased to 40 muM, the hyperbolic function converts slowly to a parabolic function. When the P(IIA) mole fraction was maintained at 0.6 and alpha-ketoglutarate levels were varied from 1 mM to 4 muM, an 800-fold increase in signal amplification was observed with respect to glutamine activation. In addition, because glutamine activates the adenylylation and inhibits the deadenylylation reaction, a sensitivity index of 2.1 (corresponding to a Hill number of 1.5) was obtained for the variation of n values in response to increasing glutamine concentration.

The thermodynamic parameters, deltaG, deltaH, and deltaS characterizing the tight binding of methotrexate, folates, and pyridine nucleotides to chicken liver dihydrofolate reductase (5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate: NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) have been determined from calorimetric and fluorescence measurements. At 25 degrees the binding of NADPH and NADP+ is characterized by small negative enthalpies and large positive entropies whereas the binding of the folates and methotrexate is accompanied by large negative enthalpies and small negative entropies. In addition, the enthalpy of methotrexate-enzyme interaction demonstrates a proton transfer associated with binding; this is not the case with folate and dihydrofolate, thus confirming the conclusions drawn from the observed difference spectra characteristic of the interaction of methotrexate and substrates with the enzyme. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the nature of the binding process, conformational changes in the enzyme, and the nature of the active site region.

A quantitative method is described for the measurement of intralysosomal pH in living cells. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (FD) is endocytized and accumulates in lysosomes where it remains without apparent degradation. The fluorescence spectrum of this compound changes with pH in the range 4-7 and is not seriously affected by FD concentration, ionic strength, or protein concentration. Living cells on coverslips are mounted in a spectrofluorometer cell and can be perfused with various media. The normal pH inside macrophage lysosomes seems to be 4.7-4.8, although it can drop transiently as low as 4.5. Exposure of the cells to various weak bases and to acidic potassium ionophores causes the pH to increase. The changes in pH are much more rapid than is the intralysosomal accumulation of the weak bases. Inhibitors of glycolysis (2-deoxyglucose) and of oxidative phosphorylation (cyanide or azide) added together, but not separately, cause the intralysosomal pH to increase. These results provide evidence for the existence of an active proton accumulation mechanism in the lysosomal membrane and support the theory of lysosomal accumulation of weak bases by proton trapping.

The physical and chemical properties of five human and one canine monoclonal cryoimmunoglobulin have been compared. By many criteria, the proteins cannot be distinguished from the noncryoglobulin reference proteins analyzed in parallel; however, certain hydrodynamic and spectroscopic properties of the proteins indicate that cryoimmunoglobulins differ in tertiary structure relative to their cold-soluble counterparts. These differences seem to favor low-temperature-induced association between cryoglobulin molecules as an immediate consequence of increased intermolecular ionic or van der Waals forces. No evidence was found for the formation of cold-dependent antigen-antibody complexes or the ubiquitous presence of low-temperature-dependent conformation changes as a component of cryoprecipitation. Rather, the anomalous solution behavior of monoclonal cryoimmunoglobulins can be considered a direct result of the individual solubility properties of these proteins.

Addition of nerve growth factor to cultures of dissociated rat adrenal medullary cells caused fiber outgrowth from chromaffin cells. These fibers exhibited all the characteristics of neurites, particularly the formation of typical growth cones exhibiting intense catecholamine-specific fluorescence. Because this nerve growth factor-mediated neurite outgrowth could be abolished by physiological concentrations of glucocorticoids, it is concluded that the high glucocorticoid concentrations normally present in the adrenal medulla prevent the fiber outgrowth from medullary chromaffin cells in vivo. In dissociated sympathetic neurons the same concentrations of glucocorticoids markedly reduce but do not completely abolish neuronal fiber outgrowth.

Behavioral sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia is the result of a prolonged increase in transmitter release from the presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons. Earlier work suggested that this presynaptic facilitation might be mediated by a serotonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase in the sensory neuron terminals. Here we present evidence that presynaptic facilitation results from a cyclic AMP-dependent increase in the calcium current that underlies action potentials in the sensory neurons. The action potentials of sensory neuron cell bodies have, in addition to a sodium current, a calcium current that is enhanced by blocking the opposing potassium current with tetraethylammonium. Under these conditions, the action potentials show a slowly repolarizing plateau that follows the Nernst potential for a calcium electrode and serves as a sensitive assay for changes in calcium current. Stimulation of the pathway that mediates sensitization, incubation with serotonin or phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or intracellular injection of cyclic AMP produces an increase in the calcium plateau in the presence of tetraethylammonium. In addition, both before and after sensitizing stimulation, the duration of the plateau potential parallels transmitter release as measured by the amplitude of monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked in the motor neurons by intracellular stimulation of single sensory neurons. These results are consistent with the idea that presynaptic facilitation is caused by a cyclic AMP-mediated increase in a voltage-sensitive calcium current in sensory neuron presynaptic terminals. This synaptic action is novel in that it can produce little or no change in the resting potential, is of long duration, and exerts its influence directly on a conductance triggered by the action potential, rather than on non-voltage-sensitive conductances, as is typical of conventional synaptic actions.

The hydrolysis of cephalexin, cephalothin and cephaloridine in strongly acid medium (10--25% sulfuric acid) at high temperature (approximately 100 degrees C) was studied. The hydrolysis proceeds with a high rate (10--15 min are necessary for complete hydrolysis) and results in definite products with low mol.-wt. The hydrolysis under such hard conditions affects the side chain in 3-position, in some cases the C--N bond in the amido group in 7-position, and leads to a total cleavage of the beta-lactam ring, giving thiazine compounds. The reaction products were identified using IR and UV spectral data, thin-layer and gas chromatography, and some characteristic reactions of functional groups. The results of the investigation were used for development of photometric procedures for determination of cephalosporins.

The effectiveness of benzodiazepines and anticholinergics administered alone or in combination in preventing restraint-immersion and forced exertion-induced gastric mucosal erosion was investigated in mice. The benzodiazepines used were diazepam and chlordiazepoxide HCI and the anticholinergics were propantheline bromide and clidinium bromide. The administratio of a benzodiazepine with an anticholinergic resulted in additive or supra-additive protective effects in both systems. In the restraint-immersion system, diazepam combined with propantheline bromide at a ratio of 1 to 13.7 yielded a 4.53-fold supra-additive effect. At ratios of 4.6 or 1.5 parts of propantheline bromide to 1 part of diazepam an additive effect was observed. One part of diazepam, when combined with 1.4 to 12.0 parts of clidinium bromide resulted in supra-additive effects of about 1.5-fold. The co-administration of chlordiazepoxide HCI and clidinium bromide in ratios of 2 to 1 or 2.5 to 1 resulted in supra-additive effects of 2.4- and 1.85-fold, respectively. At higher and lower ratios additive effects were demonstrated. In the forced exertion system, diazepam combined with either anticholinergic resulted in supra-additive effects of 2- to 3-fold which occurred at ratios of diazepam to the anticholinergic varying over an 8-fold range. The co-administration of 2 parts of chlordiazepoxide HCI and 1 part of clidinium bromide resulted in a 2.84-fold supra-additive effect in the forced exertion system. These results are discussed in relation to the use of benzodiazepine anticholinergic combinations in the treatment of human gastric and duodenal ulcer disease.

The adult population of a large mental hospital was screened for tardive dyskinesia (TD). Approximately 11% of the hospital population showed signs of TD; females and the elderly were over-represented in the TD group. A representative sample of those with TD was selected and a control (non-TD) patient was chosen to match each of the TD subjects in age, sex, length of hospitalization, diagnosis, and race. The charts of these subjects were searched for any indices of brain damage and the complete psychotropic medication history was recorded. There was no difference between the TD and controls in the amount of psychotropics ingested, in the duration of administration, in the kinds of drugs, or in the organicity history. Women as a group, however, tended to have more polypharmacy than men. The role of neuroleptics in TD is discussed as well as other possible etiological factors.

The effects of 7-chloro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-1 H, 1.4-benzodiazepin-2(3H)-one (ID-540), a recently introduced benzodiazepine derivative, on the averaged photopalpebral reflex (PPR), subjective symptoms, and serum levels of ID-540 and its principal metabolite, N-desmethyl-ID-540, following an oral dose of 0.5 mg or placebo were investigated in six male Japanese students in a double-blind, crossover design. The peak latencies of PPR showed a statistically significant prolongation, with maximum level at 3 h after administration, which recovered to the initial level within 4 h. The amplitude of PPR failed to show a definite response to the drug. The serum concentration of ID-540 reached a peak level 2-3 h after administration, and then decreased at 4 h. N-Desmethyl-ID-540 exhibited a slow- gradual rise in serum. The latencies of PPR were positively correlated with the serum level of ID-540 but not with the N-desmethyl-ID-540. It is concluded that the PPR test may be a useful method for predicting the clinical effects of psychotropic drugs.

The ability of cocaine to exert internal stimulus control of behavior was investigated by training rats to discriminate 10 mg/kg cocaine from saline in a discrete-trial, two-lever, food-reward procedure. Acquisition of response control by cocaine (1) succeeded in all animals tested, (2) proceeded rapidly, and (3) was associated with a high Commission Error: Omission Error ratio. These findings support the hypothesis that cocaine, a prototype of drugs inducing a psychotic condition in humans, can act as a powerful internal stimulus in rats. The cocaine cue was also responsive to the action of the dopamine-receptor-blocking agents spiperone (ED50: 0.06 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.24 mg/kg), and pimozide (1.90 mg/kg). d, l-Amphetamine (1.25 mg/kg) induced stimulus generalization with cocaine, and this generalization was blocked by dosages of the same neuroleptics comparable to those of cocaine antagonism. The results are discussed in terms of internal stimulus control of behavior and its relevance to the psychophysiology of schizophrenia.

Periarteritis nodosa is a severe systemic disease which is characterized by an inflammation of the vessel walls and a high incidence of renal involvement. Angiography should be performed immediately when clinical suspicion is aroused. Angiography is superior to the results of skin and muscles biopsy and gives information about the extension of the disease.

Recently, a considerable amount of phthalic acid esters (PAE), the most widely utilized plasticizer, has been released into and polluted the environment. Since their toxicity and teratogenicity, although fairly low, to experimental animals have recently been shown, the removal of them from the environment, especially from the drinking water, is desirable. As an attempt for the removal, the radiolytic degradation of 7-14C-di-n-butyl phthalate (14C-DBP) in water was investigated at several pHs. Approximately 50% of 14C-DBP (1 ppm aqueous solution) was decomposed by 60Co gamma-irradiation to a dose of 3 X 10(4) rad at pH 7 and the main product was mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP). At pHs 3 and 11 14C-DBP was more easily radiolyzed and converted to ether-soluble compounds other than MBP or phthalic acid (PA). By irradiation to 10(6) rad 14C-DBP as well as 14C-MBP and 14C-PA, at pH value tested, was almost completely decomposed to volatile or water-soluble substances of possibly low molecular weight. These findings suggest that the gamma-irradiation is effective to make the PAE-polluted water clean.

Adult rats were exposed to increasing air ethanol concentrations over a 12-day period without the use of pyrazole. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels were determined from various regions of rat brain. The enzyme levels in the pons-medulla, mid-brain and the striatum increased significantly during the 12-day exposure to ethanol. Other areas of the brain displayed a slight increase in enzyme activity, but not a significant level.

Intraventricular 6-OHDA treatment to newborn rats produced a marked reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase activity in most brain regions at maturity which correlated moderately well with the catecholamine levels. However, those regions in which NE levels were increased did not show a corresponding increase in total tyrosine hydroxylase activity. There was a much better correlation between NE levels and the particulate form of tyrosine hydroxylase which has been suggested to be the more functionally active form of the enzyme.

Female mice which received chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam, prazepam, flurazepam, or nitrazepam prenatally and postnatally had delays in the age of vaginal perforation and first estrus concomitant with reduced postnatal growth. Females exposed prenatally showed no growth deficits, but in four treatments had delayed vaginal opening. However, the age of first estrus was generally less than the control.

Ferret trachea and bronchus contract to carbachol greater than 5-HT greater than bradykinin (BK) greater than PGF2alpha greater than histamine greater than 2-methylhistamine (2-MeH: a specific H1-receptor agonist). Rat trachea is insensitive to the spasmogenic actions of histamine, 2-MeH, PGF2alpha, BK and 5-HT. Ferret trachea and bronchus and rat trachea (which were partially contracted to carbachol) relax to isoproterenol greater than PGE1 greater than E2 greater than 4-methyl-histamine (4-MeH: a specific H2-histamine receptor agonist). High doses of histamine also relax rat trachea. The contractions of ferret airways to 2-MeH coupled with the antagonism of histamine-induced contractions by mepyramine showed the presence of H1-histamine receptors in the trachea and bronchus of ferret. After H1-blockade, the relaxant responses to histamine on ferret bronchus and trachea, and rat trachea were not affecte by "specific" doses of burimamide, metiamide, and cimetidine (H2-receptor antagonists), indomethacin (PG-synthetase inhibitor) and propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocker). These results appear to suggest the existence of an atypical histamine receptor subtype (i.e. not of the classical H1 or H2 type) in the airways of rat and ferret.

The heat production (HP) of glucose deprived human red blood cells was measured, using glucose, adenine and inosine as substrates. Inosine induced a significantly higher HP than glucose and adenine induced no significant HP. At low pH the HP of glucose decreased more than that of inosine, corresponding to an equally lowered lactate production. The results indicate that it should be possible to use the system developed to study the functional state both of the complete glycolytic system and the lower part of it in intact red blood cells during various clinical conditions.

Bacteroides fragilis is responsible for most anaerobic infections in man. Most isolates of B. fragilis show resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. This resistance might be due to beta-lactamase production or permeability barrier in the cell wall. B. fragilis produce beta-lactamase with mainly cephalosporinase activity. Other Bacteroides species such as B. clostridiformis, B. melaninogenicus and B. oralis also produce beta-lactamase but with different biochemical characteristics.

We report in a five month old baby a case of the cutaneomucosal and lymph node syndrome described by Kawasaki, remarkable for the onset of multiple aneurysms involving the coronary and the limb arteries. This syndrome has rarely been observed except in Japan where it seems frequent. Possibly is benign forms, without heart complications, producing a picture of febrile erythema of viral type, have not received sufficient attention. The relationship between Kawasaki's disease and periarteritis nodosa in infants is then discussed. The clinical and pathological existence of the fatal forms seems undoubted, but the generally benign course of Kawasaki's disease contrasts with the severe course of polyarteritis nodosa in infants. It is possible that the usually benign forms of Kawasaki's disease represent only the initial stage of periarteritis nodosa in infants, from which they may recover, and we have only identified until now the severe forms which are rapidly fatal. The etiology of Kawasaki's syndrome, like periateritis nodosa remains unknown.

Granulomatous hepatitis has been associated with many conditions, including chronic ulcerative colitis and sulfonamide therapy. We report a patient with ulcerative colitis in whom hepatic granulomatosis was associated with salicylazosulfapyridine (Azulfidine). Sulfonamides should be considered a possible cause of hepatotoxicity when used therapeutically in inflammatory bowel disease.

To test the association of small bile duct destructive lesions in the liver with acute graft-versus-host disease,  a blind (coded) histological study was done comparing liver tissue from three groups of dogs given 1,200 R of total-body irradiation: one not given marrow infusions after irradiation, another given autologous hemopoietic grafts, and a third given marrow grafts from DLA-nonidentical unrelated donors. The dogs with unrelated grafts all developed graft-versus-host disease, and their liver histology was distinguished from that of the dogs in the other two groups by three findings: (1) extensive small bile ductule necrosis and atypia; (2) infiltrates of mononuclear cells around and in ductules; and (3) individual hepatocyte necrosis scattered throughout the lobules. Thus, bile duct lesions appear to be a good marker for assessing the presence and severity of hepatic graft-versus-host disease in dogs.

Two cases of megalourethra are presented, the ninth and tenth cases to be documented in the literature. Both patients exhibited mesodermal abnormalities which justify categorization among the minor forms of prune belly syndrome. One patient, the youngest to have undergone surgical correction, presented with azotemia, dilated posterior urethra, megacystis, and megaureters. The second patient with incomplete or scaphoid form of megalourethra also exhibited undescended testis, corrected by orchiopexy at the time of urethoplasty. In all instances the goal of treatment is preservation of renal function with subsequent functional and anatomic reconstruction of the urinary tract.

A familial occurrence of crossed renal ectopia is presented. No genetic factor has been determined in this congenital anomaly so this familial occurrence is believed to be incidental.

The NADP-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was studied in sketetal muscles of the rat, rabbit and frog. The dehydrogenase activity in the skeletal muscles of the rat and rabbit was higher than that of the frog. The enzyme activity was found to depend upon the buffer, being higher in tris-HCl buffer than in triethanolamine buffer.

A case is presented of a seventeen-year-old phenotypic male with empty scrotum, hormonal studies consistent with adrenogenital syndrome, a 46,XX karyotype, and a normal prostate on rectal examination. Histochemical evidence of the true nature of the prostatic tissue is presented, and the developmental aspects of the case are discussed.

In this article shall be referred to a special form of reaction of the ST-T-complexes in the propranolol test. Instead of a normalisation of this section of the ECG an inverse reaction develops. It consists in the fact that after application of propranolol the negativities of the T-waves increase and the lowerings of the ST-distances deepen. They appear most frequently after an acute heart attack, such as after a spontaneous angina pectoris, and they can be reproduced only during some days. It is supposed that the cooperation of acute ischaemic myocardial processes with negative sequelae of the blockade of beta-receptors are responsible for this inverse reaction.

This study is the result of an attempt to get effective methods in order to reduce the students' speaking anxiety in seminars. In a prepost-design, two training programs are compared: systematic desensitization and assertive training. Success is controlled with the help of a subjective anxiety scale, the "Freiburger Persönlichkeitsinventar" (FPI), and by scanning how often and how long somebody is speaking in a seminar. The main results are: both of the training programs reduce speaking anxiety signficantly (perhaps with a little more success of SD), SD also reduces "Gehemmtheit" (FPI-Scale 8). There is a lot of difficulties with regard to the observation of the behavior variables but it seems to be that Ass increases speaking frequency in relation to the groups' mean, while this effect could not be supposed according to SD. At the end of the article, the results are discussed and some questions are raised with regard to the further research of training programs.

Tests conducted on dogs with a fistula of the pancreatic duct evidenced that various amino acids mixtures containing all the essential amino acids and differing mainly in the replaceable nitrogen dissimilarly act on the external secretion of the pancreas after their introduction into the blood. The most intensive secretion produces a mixture in which the replaceable nitrogen is represented by glycine alone. The mixture, one of its constituent is one of the dicarboxylic acids (glutamic) very poorly stimulates this function. At the same time, the action of all the studied amino acids mixtures is less pronounced than is the effect of the caseine hydrolysate. The commercial agent aminofusin L-600, containing all the essential amino acids with addition of polyols (xylitol and sorbitol) with no dicarboxylic amino acids in its composition, produces an intensive pancreatic secretion close to that caused by the caseine hydrolysate.

Phenobarbital (1-2 × 10(-4)M) markedly increases the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials at the neuromuscular synapse of the frog. This effect was seen in calcium free media containing EGTA. The drug probably acts presynaptically at an intracellular locus to increase the presynaptic free calcium concentration.

Sodium tripolyphosphate dips (5 min in 12% solution) extended shelf life of thornback ray wings by about 2 days, improved the appearance and eliminated weight losses. With citric acid dips (5 min in 0.5% solution) a 3 day extension of storage life was obtained but the treatment had a slight bleaching effect and caused weight losses of about 5%. Both compounds were effective in retarding the breakdown of urea with formation of ammonia in thorback ray.

Concentrations of carbromal, carbromide and bromisoval are determined in blood, urine, brain, kidney and muscle taken at autopsy from 41 fatal cases after overdosage of bromureides. In addition values of total bromine in blood are presented. Contents of total bromine can only lead to the deduction that a chronical abuse of bromureides is existent or not. Concentrations of bromureides and carbromide show a wide range according to the different time between taking the drug and death particularly in cases of pure carbromal intoxications which sometimes cause death after several days. In such cases quantitative determination of carbromide, a pharmacologically active metabolite of carbromal, is the only way to prove an acute carbromal intoxication. Especially in cases of additional foreign substances death may occur in early the phase of poisoning. Bromureides decompose post mortem by putrefaction a high degree so that the condition of the cadaver is important. Brain tissue is the most usable material for examination but other organs, particularly muscle and kidney, can be analysed with success. For differential diagnosis fatal cases are presented which were not caused by drug intake.

Attempts were made for using industrial and agricultural by-products and wastes as carbon and nitrogen sources in fermentation medium for alpha-amylase production by Aspergillus niger NRRL-337. The original carbon source of the basal medium was replaced by one of the following materials: rice bran, wheat bran, corn bran, corn starch, cane molasses, and glucose syrup. Rice bran proved to be the best carbon source that secured the highest amylase activity. The nitrogen source of the basal medium was then replaced by different cheap materials, viz: dried yeast, corn steep liquor, gluten-30, gluten-50, and corn steep precipitate. Corn steep precipitate proved to be superior in amylase production. In consideration of these results an economical medium that secured high activity, containing the following ingredients, was suggested: 2.5% corn steep precipitate, 7.2% rice bran, 0.1% MgSO4, 0.1% KH2PO4, and 0.1% CaCO3. From this medium fungal amylase was precipitated and purified. The pure enzyme gave the highest activity at 40 degrees C and pH 4.3.

In a double-blind study the effectiveness of benorylate and indomethacin was compared in patients suffering from cervical spine syndromes. From a total of 60 patients, 30 individuals (group A) received 100 mg of indomethacin/day and 30 (group B) were treated with 6 g of benorylate per day. Clinical improvement as judged by several given criteria occurred in 80% of the patients in group A and in 76.7% of the patients in group B. If strict objective criteria (ie. increased mobility) were used, 53.3% improved in both groups, while subjective criteria revealed improvement in 76.7% in both groups. Neurological signs improved in 36.7% in group A and in 30% in group B. In two patients treatment with indomethacin was discontinued because of severe side effects. In the benorylate treated group 3 patients had to be taken off treatment for the same reason. Side effects were mainly gastro-intestinal. The study indicates that with regard to clinical effectiveness benorylate is comparable to indomethacin in patients suffering from cervical spine syndromes; the substance is cheap and relatively tolerable.

Experiences by continuous ultrasonic measurements during pregnancy. The authors have published earlier a diagram for use to evaluate the fetal development. The aptitude in practice has been proved.--To evaluate normal fetal growth the percentiles curves of Lubchenco are less suitable than of the GDR. But also the last show the normal weight 100 to 150 g to small during the 30th to 36th gestation week in comparison to the calculated fetal weight of normal pregnancies. The intrauterine retardation and hypertrophy can well be diagnosed if the beginning of the measures occurs at the end of the first trimenon of the pregnancy. But it is necessary to know the possibilities of apparent "abnormalities" in normal pregnancy, as ceccation of the fetal growth for 3 or 4 weeks, the late flattening of the biparietal diameter in breech presentation etc.--Our effort to simulatae the fetal growth in intrauterine retardation by using beta-stimulating sympathicomimetics, was without of success.

The value of a general pH analysis of the artery umbilicalis as a parameter of the postnatal diagnostic of the newborns is shown. The classification of the values in different grades of acidity and the relation to the Apgar score show, that the light and middle-heavy acidoses are not determined sufficiently by the Apgar score. The CTG-monitoring and the stimulation of the Oxytocin had no influence on the frequency of the different grades of the acidity. The meaning of the general blood-gas analysis in the artery umbilicalis for the morbidity of acidity and the check of the obstetrical activity of the clinic is shown.

The author studied the influence on the adaptation of the nervous tissue explantations from 25 fetuses of schizophrenic mothers and a similar amount of fetuses from normal women (embryonal development--7-12 weeks) during the initial period of explantation in vitro (5-6 days) with 10 psychopharmacological preparations (aminasine, majeptile, stelasine, triphtasine, tesercin, theralen, haloperidol, eglonyl, mellipramin, seduxen). Their final concentration in a nourishing medium was approximately the same as in the blood of schizophrenic patients, treated by phenothiasine preparations. The adaptation of the fetus pervous tissue from schizophrenic mothers differed from the corresponding reaction of fetus brain explantation from normal women. There was a tendency to a higher stability of experimental cultures. However, there were differences depending upon the character of introduced drugs.

1) In intact Ehrlich ascites tumour cells the anaerobic glycolytic flux rate and pattern of intermediates have been investigated at different pH values of the extracellular medium. 2) As predicted from the dependence of the lactic acid dehydrogenase equilibrium on pH a strong negative correlation between log ([lactate]/[pyruvate]) and pH has been found. 3) The steady state fluxes of glycolysis at pH 8.0 and 7.4 are rather equal, despite significant differences in the intracellular concentrations of glycolytic intermediates. At pH 8.0 the concentrations of ATP, glucose 6-phosphate, and fructose 6-phosphate are lower, and the concentrations of ADP, AMP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, triose phosphates, phosphoglycerates, and phosphoenolpyruvate are higher than at pH 7.4. 4) From the analysis of the pH dependent changes of metabolites it follows that different mechanisms are responsible for maintaining equal actual activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase at pH 7.4 and 8.0. 5) From an application of the linear theory of enzymatic chains and a calculation of the control strength of the regulatory important enzymes results that hexokinase is evidently rate-limiting for glycolysis, and phosphofructokinase is also significantly influencing the glycolytic flux. Pyruvate kinase and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, on the other hand, do not significantly affect the rate of the overall glycolytic flux in ascites.

We present the central haemodynamic data obtained during halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia in a patient under antihypertensive treatment with propranolol who underwent surgery for intracranial aneurysms in sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension. Cardiac output remained unchanged when hypotension was induced. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased. There was a slight increase in heart rate, as well as a minor decrease in stroke volume. Systemic vascular resistance decreased, but pulmonary vascular resistance remained unchanged. The response observed is discussed.

In 30 patients blood samples were taken from both radial arteries and analysed for PCO2, PO2 and pH. The influence of sampling technique on the accuracy of blood-gas analysis was determined. The 95% confidence limits for PCO2 measurements were +/-0.32 kPa (2.4 mmHg), and for PO2 measurements were +/-1.16 kPa (8.8 mmHg) in the range below 20 kPa, and +/-2.94 kPa (22.0 mmHg) above 20 kPa. For pH, the 95% confidence limits were +/-0.014. Only the PO2 measurements were significantly influenced by the sampling procedure.

Bovine liver porphobilinogenase (PBGase) has been covalently attached to Sepharose, and some of their properties have been studied. The optimal conditions for binding have been determined. The water-insoluble PBGase retained a high percentage of the activity of the soluble enzyme; the coupling yield was also high. Sepharose-PBGase could be stored at 4 C for periods up to 5 weeks with 40% loss of activity; however, both by storage and repeated use, isomerase was inactivated and the percentage of uroporphyrinogen I formed was increased. Attachment of PBGase to Sepharose has led to enhanced thermal stability. pH optima of the insolubilized enzyme was shifted 0.6 units towards the alkaline side as compared to that of the native enzyme.

The starch synthase activity of bundle sheath cells of maize leaves is very low in darkened plants and increases on illumination. In order to find an explanation of these facts we subjected leaf strips, isolated bundle sheath cells and enzymic preparations to pH-changes and to oxidizing or reducing substances. We found that the increase of the activity produced by light could also be caused in the leaf strips by adding malate to the suspending fluid in the dark. On the contrary, with isolated bundle sheath cells no increase with light or with the addition of malate could be observed. There was a decrease of activity due to acidification or to the addition of dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP). The same effect could be observed with enzymic preparations as with the isolated bundle sheath cells, whereas the decrease of activity was higher by acidification of samples coming from darkened plants than for those enzymes prepared from illuminated plants. Also other substances inhibited the synthase activity: benzoquinone, DOPA, caffeic acid, TMPD or Fe (CN6) 3- and PCMB, while only DTE could increase it. After preincubation with PCMB the enzyme activity could be restored with DTE, not so for the preincubation with DCPIP. With an enzymic preparation that contained intact organelles the increase of activity could also be produced by NADH. Thus we follow that the decrease of synthase activity in the darkened plants is due to acidification and to the presence of oxidizing substances, too.

1 - Five patients with severe metabolic acidosis secondary to methanol poisoning were studied before and after receiving 6.7 to 10 mEq NaHCO3/kg body weight. 2 - Two thirds of the infused HCO3- left the extracellular space and, since its apparent volume of distribution was much larger than under normal conditions, it largely overestimated HCO3- needs. On the contrary, the volume of distribution of the buffer base excess was found to be more stable and little affected by the acid-base status. 3 - Based on these observations, a simple method for estimating HCO3- needs in severe metabolic acidosis is proposed, requiring only the initial excess buffer base space which is calculated from body weight and blood buffer base excess values obtained before and after a first dose of bicarbonate.

Ethylephrine, assayed in isolated rat atria, as a dose-chronotropic response curve showed a typical bell-dome shape of the sympathomimetic amines. Yet, on the same basis, it was less powerful than epinephrine, norepinephrine or isoproterenol. Pretreatment with reserpine provoked supersensitivity and increase in the maximum. As well, previous administration of pargyline to the animals resulted in augmented accelerating effects, either in normal or reserpinized preparations. Cocaine or phentolamine shifted the dose-response curve to the left. On the contrary, propranolol, produced a marked action, decelerating the effects of ethylephrine and also decreased the maxima with higher doses. It is concluded that ethylephrine: a) is a direct-acting sympathomimetic amine; b) it brings beta-receptor stimulation; c) a certain degree of alpha-receptor decelerating effect is also involved; d) it is a good substrate of monoaminoxidase.

The lack of any rotational behaviour in unilaterally dopamine lesioned animals after ipecacuana or emetine is a strong indication that these substances lack dopamine receptor stimulating properties when administered systematically. Our results thus support those of Lal et al. (1972). Our results do not allow any conclusions concerning the working mechanism of emetine. However, the lack of central dopamine receptor stimulating properties should probably not be explained by an inability to enter through the blood brain barrier but rather a lack of effect on dopamine receptors. This reasoning  would also exclude the dopamine receptors in the chemo-trigger zone as responsible for the emetic effect. In terms of the clinical usage of ipecacuana it seems highly improbable that this usage may cause adverse psychotic like side effects due to stimulation of central dopamine receptors.

After a 12-week preliminary period of observation 32 patients with consistently active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were treated for up to 22 weeks with salazopyrin. Seven patients could not tolerate the drug. The remaining 25 patients had a marked improvement in subjective clinical state and significant falls in serum C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 6 weeks after treatment began. The improvement was maintained after 22 weeks. The results strongly suggest that further trials with this drug in RA are needed.

1450 random serum samples of domestic ruminants from Egypt, Somalia and Jordan were investigated for complement fixing antibodies against Rickettsia and Chlamydia. Between 1.5 and 3.4% of the samples from the animals investigated had antibodies against the RMSF-group of Rickettsia, with exception of the sera from Somalian cattle and sheep from Jordan. Antibodies against Rickettsia of the Typhus-group were found in 4 cattle and 1 goat from Jordan and 2 sheep from Egypt; by agglutination test with type-specific antigen they were identified as antibodies against R. typhi. Using 2 different antigens, antibodies against Coxiella burnetii were found in every population tested. The prevalence was 2.0 to 12.2%, with the exception of cattle in Somalia, where only 1 positive serum (0.2%) was found. 27% of the serum samples from Jordan and 22% from Egypt but none of the 802 samples from Somalia had antibodies against Chlamydia. The results are discussed under an epidemiological point of view.

Epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi obtained from acellular culture as well as bloodstream trypomastigotes agglutinate with concanavalin A (Con A). Con A-binding sites were also localized on the cell membrane by using the Con A-horseradish peroxidase-diaminobenzidine method. Passage of epimastigotes and trypomastigotes from acellular culture through DEAE-cellulose column did not affect Con A-binding sites as detected by agglutination and electron miscroscopy.

The development of motile stages, called kinetes, from a stationary stage (regarded as zygote) has been followed in Theileria parva by means of electron miscroscopy. This process started after moult of the tick nymphs which had sucked on highly infected calves, i.e. about 20 days after repletion (a.r.) of the ticks. The transformation took place by formation of a growing protrusion (= anlage) into an inner, enlarging vacuole. During this process the limiting membrane of the enlarging vacuole serves as the outer membrane of the developing motile stage, whereas the two inner ones as well as the subpellicular microtubules are newly formed. This transformation proceeds rapidly, so that on the 25th day a.r. most of the kinetes have already left the gut cells and started penetration into the salivary gland cells. On the way to the salivary glands nuclear divisions occurred within the kinetes. The steps of the transformation described were compared to those in T. annulata and to ookinete formation in haemosporidia.

The course of a primary infection with Dipetalonema viteae was studied in one randomly bred and in one inbred strain of hamster. Worm recovery and the duration and intensity of the microfilaraemia were analyzed and related to the humoral immune response of the host by using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test on frozen sections of female worms, on eggs and on intact microfilariae. The inbred strain showed a greater susceptibility to the parasite. This was evidenced by high worm recovery and prolonged microfilaraemia. The duration of microfilaraemia did not depend on the number of recovered female worms. Most of the randomly bred hamsters suppressed microfilaraemia by week 30 post infection whereas some hamsters of the inbred strain were still microfilaraemic. Splenectomy prior to infection did not affect the duration of microfilaraemia. Antibodies to the cuticle of microfilariae always appeared in the sera after immunity to circulating microfilariae had been built up.

Peritoneal exudate cells from normal uninfected hamsters adhered in vitro to microfilariae in the presence of 19S antibody fractions from hamsters which had suppressed or were going to suppress their microfilaremia. The adhering cells were predominantly mononuclear, although eosinophils were occasionally found. Experiments with sensitized microfilariae and peritoneal exudate cells indicated that the macrophage probably recognizes the microfilariae/antibody complex. Macrophage cytophilic antibodies did not seem to be involved. This adhesion reaction may initiate the trapping of microfilariae in vivo, thus contributing to the observed acquired immunity to circulating microfilariae in the hamster.

In this study, carried out in the Ivory Coast, Dicrocoelium hospes Looss, 1907 was shown for the first time to be a parasite of cattle and it was also detected in sheep by the presence of ova in the faeces. Up to 50% of the sheep in some flocks were found to shed eggs. The adults, sporocysts, "slime balls" and cercariae of D. hospes are described and compared to the respective stages of D. dendriticum. This comparison shows that essential morphological structures are very similar, especially the sensory papillae, which as so called chaetotaxis can serve to distinguish closely related species. The cercariae develop in terrestrial snails of the genus Limicolaria of which several species may play a role (L. flammea, L. felina, L. kambeul). The main habitat of D. hospes seems to be limited to savannah environment; only once could D. hospes be found in the borderzone between savannah and the rain forest. Infected Limicolaria-snails shed the cercariae in amorphous "slime balls" of liquid-jelly-like consistency and yellowish colour. Under the influence of sunlight these liquify; the cercariae, however, can survive for up to 26 h. According to our present knowledge the sunlight seems to be a factor which triggers the shedding of slime balls. This begins shortly after sunrise at a temperature of 22 degrees C and a relative humidity of 100%. Infected snails can shed cercariae on seven consecutive days. This kind of slime ball production might provide a clue to the 2nd intermediate host; efforts to identify this host have, however, so far been fruitless, despite the fact that almost 4000 arthropods, mainly ants, have been investigated.

Two patients with acute Kala Azar were studied with DF32P (diisopropylfluorophosphate) and three patients with 51Cr (chromate) in an attempt to delineate the mechanism producing neutropenia in this disease. The granulocyte life span was found to be reduced in all the patients with exception of one who was studied during Glucantim treatment. The surface radioactivity counts showed that the reduced granulocyte life span was due to pooling and probable destruction of granulocytes in the spleen and to a lesser degree in the liver. Bone marrow neutrophil reserve, evaluated by the response to the intravenous hydrocortisone hemisuccinate, was found to be markedly reduced in all patients. An enlarged marginal granulocyte pool indicated also that the neutropenia may be due to altered intravascular granulocyte distribution.

Non-directional blood velocity of left internal mammary bypass grafts was non-invasively studied with the Doppler ultrasonic probe. Thirteen of 14 subjects had angiographic evidence of bypass graft patency and their Doppler signals demonstrated high amplitude phasic blood velocities. A single patient with proximal left internal mammary arterial graft occlusion manifested marked attenuation of Doppler blood velocity signals. It is concluded that this technic offers a potential for ambulatory and in-office screening of internal mammary artery bypass graft function.

Hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance are well known phenomena occurring in patients with renal failure. In contrast to true diabetic subjects, an elevated ratio of insulin to glucose during the glucose tolerance test is consistently observed indicating a peripheral insulin insensitivity. Among the possible reasons, a disturbance at the cellular level seems to be most likely. There is some evidence of reduced peripheral glucose utilization on the one hand and increased hepatic glucose output--probably by stimulation of gluconeogenesis--on the other. Agents that have been suggested to be involved in these alterations of carbohydrate metabolism in uremia are hormones, electrolytes, pH, and "toxic" metabolic intermediates or end-products. Of these, an increase in insulin antagonistic hormones; among them growth hormone, catecholamines, and glucagon, seems to be of most significance. Although for the individual hormones no equivocal correlation with glucose intolerance has been proved, the interaction of all of them may result in a preponderance of insulin antagonism thus leading to an apparent insulin resistance.

Arterial blood concentrations of ketone bodies, pyruvate, lactate, citrate, and oxoglutarate were measured in normal and in nephrectomized rats. The rate of removal from the circulation of an infused acetoacetate load has been studied in both groups of animals. Blood oxoglutarate and ketone bodies remained unchanged in nephrectomized rats. Blood citrate level rose rapidly. In rats with normal blood pH the contribution of the kidneys to the removal of ketone bodies is 28%, whereas in metabolic alkalosis, it is less than 2%. In nephrectomized rats with normal blood pH and in rats with metabolic alkalosis the ratio between beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate is very high in comparison with rats having metabolic acidosis. These data suggest that in metabolic alkalosis the kidneys are not able to utilize ketone bodies.

A case of total ulcerative colitis associated with large-vessel disease consistent with a diagnosis of Takayasu's disease is described in a 21-year-old Pakistani female. The possible relationship between the two disorders is discussed.

Amino acid absorption was studied in chronic uremic rats. Intestinal transport of L-leucine appears to be inhibited with mild uremic intoxication, whereas severe uremia enhances absorption. Brush border activity of intestinal maltase and disaccharidases is higher in rats with chronic renal insufficiency. The same holds for gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase activity.

Chronic intrauterine hypoxia was induced in third-trimester lamb fetuses by daily embolization of the maternal side of the placenta with nonradioactive microspheres. After delivery at term, the chronically hypoxic fetuses had significantly increased pulmonary artery pressures when compared to nonhypoxic control measurements. This preparation appears to be a satisfactory model for experimental study of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the neonate.

An improved continuous tissue pH monitoring system, designed for human subcutaneous fetal scalp tissue, was evaluated in 10 cats for total of 60 hours. Respiratory acidosis was induced with and without hypoxia to model the pathology of human clinical fetal distress. Arterial and venous pH were sampled every 15 minutes and the values were compared to those from the pH monitor system. The values paralleled arterial and venous blood pH, with correlation coefficients up to 0.98 under various pathologic acidotic conditions.

Effects of E. coli endotoxin upon uterine activity and maternal and fetal condition were studied in four pregnant baboons and their fetuses. Uterine activity increased significantly following administration of endotoxin to the mother. Endotoxin also produced maternal circulatory collapse, severe acidosis, and profound fetal asphyxia resulting in death. Death also occurred in three of the four mothers within 24 hours without amelioration of their conditions.

Tubular basement membranes in kidney biopsies from 18 patients with nephropathia epidemica were studied by electron microscopy. Both in the cortex and in the medulla there was splitting of the basement membrane. Thickened basement membrane around occasional tubules contained membrane vesicles, usually empty but also with a core and a diameter of approximately 180 nm. Membranous convoluted structures and light finely fibrillar areas in the basement membranes were seen. Splitting of the basement membrane was most prominent in the medulla, and the membrane was filled with round to oval particles 55 to 470 nm in diameter. Of the possible mechanisms of damage at the basement membrane level in this disease, the findings suggest liberation of antigen from the tubular cells and reaction of circulating antibodies with the antigen in the basement membrane.

A reaction is described in erythrocytes of rat and of man whereby O-methylated metabolites of the catecholamines are demethylated to the corresponding catechols. The reaction was studied by incubating aliquots of erythrocyte lysates with radiolabeled O-methylated compounds and isolating the catechol product by alumina adsorption chromatography. The demethylating activity was located in the cytosol of the erythrocytes. Evidence was strong that oxyhemoglobin was responsible for the reaction: the demethylase activity was inseparable from oxyhemoglobin in several chromatographic separations. In addition, although commercially available hemoglobins were inactive in the reactions, after their conversion to oxyhemoglobin and purification, they did effect demethylation. Methemoglobin did not demethylate guaiacols and in fact inhibited demethylation by oxyhemoglobin. The reaction was inhibited by the addition of reduced pyridine nucleotides and of the methyl acceptor tetrahydrofolic acid.

This review of urinary acidification is primarily based on studies in isolated epithelia such as the turtle bladder. Despite the lack of unambiguous proof, the wealth of indirect evidence suggests that the cause of bicarbonate absorption is H+ secretion into the lumen. The mechanisms that regulate H+ transport are discussed. The electrochemical gradient for protons across the membrane is found to be the most fundamental regulator not only of passive movement but also of active transport. CO2 and aldosterone stimulate H+ transport, the latter by a mechanism apparently separate from the effect of this hormone on sodium transport. Although carbonic anhydrase activity is important for optimal function of the H+ pump, the results with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors need to be interpreted with caution. The evidence for Na:H exchange is reviewed and found to be not very persuasive, The metabolic pathways that fuel H+ transport are found to be all the major energy-yielding reactions in the cell, but particular prominence is given to the new discovery of the role of the pentose shunt in energizing transport. Finally, I discuss the important role H+ transport in energy transduction in subcellular organelles.

Hemodynamic functions and blood viscosity changes in hypothermia (core approximately 25 degrees C) were studied in 14 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs subjected to surface cooling. The viscosity of blood (eta B) increased progressively to 173% of that at 37 degrees C when body temperature was lowered to 25 degrees C. The increase in blood viscosity was caused by: a) the direct effect of low temperature on plasma viscosity, b) hemoconcentration as a result of plasma loss, and c) the low-flow (low-shear) state induced by hypothermia. A larger portion of the increased viscosity was caused by the low-flow state in hypothermia. The systemic flow resistance (SFR) increased to 271% of control, and this was attributable about equally to the increases in blood viscosity and systemic vascular hindrance (SFR/eta B). Similarly, the viscosity of blood contributed significantly to raising the pulmonary flow resistance. The relative constancy of mixed venous O2 saturation suggests that the cardiac output at low body temperature is generally adequate to meet the metabolic needs.

Because municipal solid waste may contain fecal material from a variety of sources, there is concern that the leachate discharged from some solid waste landfills may contain enteric pathogens, including enteric viruses. In this study, 22 leachate samples from 21 different landfills in the United States and Canada were examined for enteric viruses. The sites represented a broad range of conditions for solid waste landfills and the leachate samples ranged from 10.3 to 18 liters in volume. Enteric viruses were found in only one of the 22 leachate samples examined. Two viruses, identified as poliovirus types 1 and 3, were found in an 11.8 liter sample obtained from a site where solid waste landfill practice was deficient. The low levels of enteric viruses detected in field samples of raw leachate and the opportunities for further reductions in the virus concentration of leachates by such processes as thermal inactivation, removal by soil and dilution in ground and surface waters, suggest that leachates from properly operated solid waste landfills do not constitute an environmental or public health hazard due to enteric viruses.

After observing that lavage of the stomach with alkaline solutions has a beneficial effect on the control of gastric hemorrhage, we examined the platelet and coagulation factor activities under conditions of lower and elevated pH. The results showed that change of the pH from acidosis to 7.0 and even to slight alkalosis induces platelet aggregation, platelet calcium and serotonin release, as well as platelet factor II availability. The prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times approached normal levels, whereas the fibrinogen level did not change significantly. The results obtained may serve as an explanation for the control of the intragastric bleeding in patients treated by maintenance of their gastric pH at 7.0.

Glutathione depletion following inhalation of halogenated anesthetics was investigated as a possible mechanism of toxic reactions associated with anesthesia. Concentrations of reduced glutathione were measured in the blood, liver, lung and kidney of the mouse after anesthesia with enflurane, fluroxene, halothane, isoflurane, methoxyflurane, or trichloroethylene. The anesthetic had no effect on glutathione concentrations in tissues except when fluroxene was used. After two hours of fluroxene anesthesia, glutathione in liver, lung, kidney, and blood was depleted by 93, 85, 85, and 61 per cent, respectively. The depletion was dose-dependent and was more extensive in animals anesthetized after phenobarbital pretreatment. Glutathione was also depleted in livers and lungs of rats anesthetized with fluroxene (60 and 38 per cent, respectively). In blood of rhesus monkeys anesthetized with fluroxene, glutathione was depleted by only 13 per cent. Extents of glutathione depletion are related to fluroxene toxicities in the three species studied.

Servocontrol of mechanical ventilation using systemic arterial blood pH, measured by a dual-function pH/PCO2 intra-arterial sensor, as the controlled variable uas carried out in 30 dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg. The control loop consisted of the animal, an intra-arterial dual-function pH/PCO2 sensor and sensor amplifier, a controller, and a Siemans-Elema 900 servoventilator. The system responded appropriately to changes in set-point pH from 7.30 to 7.50, as well as to infusions of lactic acid, which, with the control loop open, decreased systemic arterial blood pH 0.1 TO 0.2 PH units. Long-term (16 hr) ventilation of one dog with the systemic arterial blood pH servocontrol ventilator was shown to be feasible.

A dose-and-time related-effect of oral phenyltoloxamine citrate, a Class I, H1 antihistamine compound, has been demonstrated against allergen-induced wheal-and-erythema skin reactions among 10 adults with a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and seasonal pollinosis. Clinical improvement in the existing symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, pruritus and sneezing, showed a significant correlation with the inhibition of reagin-mediated skin reactivity caused by phenytoloxamine. No adverse side effects were observed. It can be concluded that oral phenyltoloxamine citrate possesses antihistaminic properties and a range of safety which make it a useful agent for the symptomatic management of upper respiratory allergy.

20 mg of medazepam were taken by mouth by 9 healthy volunteers in an acute absorption study. About a 10-fold variation was found during the first 6 hours after the drug in individual serum medazepam, diazepam, and N-desmethyldiazepam levels. In a subacute study 10 mg of medazepam t.i.d. was given to 10 institutionalized mentally subnormal adults with emotional disorders. After 14 days' treatment serum N-desmethyldiazepam levels were generally above 800 ng/ml, 7 to 8 times higher than the serum medazepam or diazepam levels measured 12 hours after the last dose. No correlation was observed between the serum concentration and efficacy of medazepam.

The efficacy and toleration of a new beta1-selective beta-blocker, H 87/07, was compared with placebo in 33 patients with angina pectoris. The efficacy was evaluated using subjective assessments of attack rate and nitroglycerin consumption as well as objective assessments of exercise tolerance on a bicycle ergometer. H 87/07 significantly reduced the attack rate and the nitroglycerin consumption compared with placebo. The mean reduction amounted to 13 and 36% respectively. No significant differences were found between H 87/07 and placebo with regard to exercise tolerance. Due to high intrinsic stimulating activity (I.S.A.) H 87/07 altered the heart rate and blood pressure only slightly at rest but during exercise significant reductions were seen. Except for one patient who had cardiac decompensation on H 87/07 no side-effects of clinical importance were seen. No significant changes were seen with regard to the laboratory tests performed.

Chloramphenicol-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration, 12.5 mug/ml) were isolated from a stool specimen which contained multiply resistant Escherichia coli. The enzyme responsible for resistance, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, was produced constitutively by these strains; the specific activity was 10-fold lower than that of the E. coli enzymes. Similar activity was not detected in susceptible B. fragilis strains, nor could it be induced by growth in the presence of chloramphenicol or by mutagenesis. The enzyme had a pH optimum of 7.8 and a molecular weight of approximately 89,000. The K(m) for chloramphenicol was 5.2 muM, and the enzyme was sensitive to inhibition by 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. The enzyme produced by an E. coli strain isolated from the same specimen had a similar K(m) and sensitivity to 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid.

5-Carboxy-2'-deoxyuridine (5-COOH-2'-dUrd) is a product of the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of 5-trifluoromethyl-2'-deoxyuridine. Hydrolysis of 5-trifluoromethyl-2'-deoxyuridine to 5-COOH-2'-dUrd in phosphate-buffered saline was kinetically first order and was pH dependent. At 37 degrees C and pH 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0, hydrolysis occurred with rate constants of 4.19 x 10(-5), 9.30 x 10(-5), and 1.61 x 10(-4) s(-1), respectively, with corresponding half-lives of 45.7, 20.6, and 11.9 h. 5-COOH-2'-dUrd inhibited growth of HEp-2 cells by 21, 67, and 91% at 1.0, 10, and 100 muM, with no antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 or herpes simplex virus type 2 at 1.0 or 10 muM. Partial reversal of cytotoxicity in HEp-2 cells was achieved with orotidine, uridine, deoxythymidine, or deoxycytidine, whereas complete reversal of cytotoxic effects was achieved with simultaneous addition of deoxythymidine, deoxycytidine, and uridine. 5-COOH-2'-dUrd at 50 muM inhibited incorporation of [(14)C]orotate into RNA and DNA by 65 and 27%, respectively. 5-COOH-2'-dUrd had no effect on the incorporation of [(3)H]uridine into DNA or RNA. Because of the structural similarities to deoxythymidine, 5-COOH-2'-dUrd was tested as an inhibitor of deoxythymidine kinase. 5-COOH-2'-dUrd was neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of herpes simplex virus type 1 induced deoxythymidine kinase or HEp-2 cell deoxythymidine kinase. Based on these observations, the metabolic block induced by 5-COOH-2'-dUrd has been localized to the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway between orotate phosphoribosyl transferase and orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase.

Pyrithione is a general inhibitor of membrane transport processes in fungi. A brief preincubation of Penicillium mycelia with pyrithione resulted in a marked decrease in the activities of a variety of independently regulated transport systems, including those for inorganic sulfate, inorganic phosphate, methylamine (actually, the NH(4) (+) permease), choline-O-sulfate, glucose, l-methionine (a specific system), and several hydrophobic l-alpha-amino acids (the general amino acid permease). The degree of inhibition at any fixed pyrithione concentration and exposure time increased as the pH of the incubation medium was decreased. This result strongly suggests that the active species is the un-ionized molecule and that pyrithione acts by collapsing a transmembrane DeltapH driving force. The degree of transport inhibition caused by a given concentration of pyrithione increased with increasing time of exposure to the inhibitor. However, exposure time and pyrithione concentration were not reciprocally related. At "low" pyrithione concentrations, transport inhibition plateaued at some finite value. This observation suggests that the fungi can detoxify low levels of the inhibitor. The concentration of pyrithione required for a given degree of growth inhibition increased as the experimental mycelial density increased. This phenomenon was consistent with the suggestion that the fungi are capable of inactivating pyrithione.

Streptococcin A-FF22 (SA) was shown to occur as both a cell-associated (SA-CA) and an extracellular (SA-EX) component of cultures of the producer bacterium, group A streptococcus strain FF22. SA-CA was solubilized by chemical, enzymatic, and mechanical procedures, similar to those used to release M protein. The independence of SA and M protein in strain FF22 was established by chromatographic separation of the two proteins on the basis of molecular weight and isoelectric point differences between the two substances. Media supporting optimal growth of strain FF22 did not necessarily favor SA production. SA was not produced either at elevated temperatures (39 degrees C) or if the culture was maintained at pH 7 or higher. The release of SA from producer cells was enhanced at lower culture pH values. Much of the SA-CA activity seemed associated with the cell walls of the producer strain, and the nature of the binding appeared to be largely nonspecific in nature and attributable to electrostatic interaction.

The in vitro activity of a new semisynthetic penicillin, piperacillin, was determined against 577 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. A concentration of 12.5 mug/ml inhibited 92% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 82% of Serratia marcescens, 73% of Escherichia coli, 61% of Klebsiella spp., and 42% of Enterobacter spp. Most Proteus spp. were extremely susceptible; over 85% were inhibited by 0.10 mug/ml. Piperacillin failed to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacilli when large inocula were used. The type of media and pH had variable effects on the activity of piperacillin, depending upon the organism. Piperacillin was generally less active than PC-904 against gram-negative bacilli, but was consistently more active than carbenicillin and ticarcillin.

Effects of bucolome on congenitally jaundiced Gunn rats were examined. Plasma total bilirubin level fell immediately after a single injection of bucolome and the lowered level persisted for more than 6 hours. Plasma unbound-bilirubin level and cerebellar bilirubin content increased simultaneously with the drop in total plasma bilirubin level. Kernicterus was observed in the brains of the treated rats 6 hours after the treatment. LD50 of the drug in jaundiced rats was about 37 mg/kg, about one-tenth of the value in nonjaundiced rats. It is suggested that bucolome displaces bilirubin from albumin, transferring bilirubin from blood into tissues including the brain, and resulting in kernicterus. The use of bucolome in infants with hyperbilirubinaemia is inadvisable.

The concentration of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was determined in eccrine, thermal sweat of 56 healthy men (ages 20--60 years) and 48 healthy women (ages 17--55 years). Samples of sweat were collected from the chest and back.

Amoxapine possesses a broad spectrum of psychotropic actions, including antidepressant and neuroleptic effects in animals. Antidepressant activity is characterized by its ability to inhibit tetrabenazine-induced depression, antagonize reserpine-induced hypothermia and enhance yohimbine lethality. Neuroleptic activity is demonstrated by the ability of amoxapine to decrease locomotor activity, induce ptosis and catalepsy, inhibit apomorphine gnawing and amphetamine stereotyped behavior and by characteristic changes in monkey discriminated avoidance behavior. The fact that punished responding in squirrel monkeys was present was present after repeated administration may indicate an anti-anxiety action of this drug. Evidence is offered that the conversion of the tertiary terminal nitrogen to a secondary amine may alter the pharmacologica properties of dibenzoxazepines in a similar way to the for the phenothiazines.

The surgical management of short esophagus with stricture has been simplified in recent years by the introduction of an esophageal lengthening procedure (Collis gastroplasty) combined with antireflux maneuvers, such as the Belsey and Nissen operations. This report compares the experimental and clinical manometric findings after these procedures. After myectomy of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in the cat, three experimental groups were developed including Collis gastroplasty, Collis-Belsey and Collis-Nissen. formation of a gastric tube did not provide protection against reflux while the Collis-Nissen procedure was more effective than the Collis-Belsey in raising pressures at the high pressure zone (HPZ) (26.0 +/- 3.5 cm H2O vs 15.0 +/- 2.7) and in preventing reflux (pH 6.3 +/- 0.5 vs 2.9 +/- 0.04). Of 20 patients with short esophagus and stricture, 11 underwent a Collis-Belsey procedure and nine a Collis-Nissen procedure. The latter procedure resulted in an HPZ of greater amplitude and length than the Collis-Belsey (18.7 +/- 2.3 mm Hg vs 11.6 +/- 1.7 and 3.9 +/- 0.4 cm vs 2.4 +/- 0.2). It also proved to be a more effective antireflux procedure, for no patient so treated had a positive pH reflux test after operation whereas after the Collis-Belsey procedure all but one patient had a positive pH reflux test. Short-term clinical results also support the superiority of the Collis-Nissen operation.

When guinea-pigs were treated for 24 days with digitoxin 0.3 mg/kg s.c., the activity of the (Na + K)-ATPase of the heart muscle increased by about 30% compared to controls, whereas the enzymes prepared from kidney and brain showed no significant alteration in their activity. In animal species treated with digitoxin for 1 to 5 days, no increase of enzyme activity was observed. Only after 10 to 15 days of treatment, a significant increase of the (Na + K)-ATPase activity was noted which increased no further with treatment up to 24 days. There was no significant difference in the kinetic properties of the (Na + K)-ATPase prepared from digitoxin-treated animals compared to those from control animals; the KM-values for ATP remained unchanged, and there was the same dependence of the activity on the K+-concentration and the same sensitivity towards digitoxin. As there appears to be no significant change in the specific properties of the enzyme, the increase in activity may possibly be caused by an increase in the amount of enzyme as a result of an adaptive enzyme regulation.

In vitro studies performed on slices of rat submaxillary gland to evaluate uptake and efflux of 14C-benzylpenicillin (10(-6)M, 10(-5)M) showed that uptake of 14C-benzylpenicillin was not significantly altered by aeration with N2, addition of 10(-5)M CN- or 10(-3) M probenecid, or substitution of K2SO4 in place of NaCl in the KRT buffer to produce a depolarizing solution. Lowering the extracellular pH (pHe) resulted in increases rates of uptake and efflux, whereas increasing the pHe resulted in decreased rates. The in vivo uptake of penicillin into whole glands excised from rates treated in vivo was very similar to that seen in the slice preparation. However, addition of probenecid to salivary gland slices in vitro decreased the rate of effux. These data suggest that the movement of penicillin in the rat salivary gland may occur by a two-step mechanism: (1) passive exchange of penicillin into the gland dependent on the degree of dissociation of penicillin, and (2) active excretion of the drug from the gland by a transport mechanism similar to that of the kidney densitive to probenecid.

Deoxycytidine antagonizes the analgesic action of morphine in the rat, morphine-induced respiratory depression in the rabbit and mitigates withdrawal in the dependent mouse. Administration of deoxycytidine does not precipitate the abstinence syndrome in dependent mice, a property shared by certain other endogenous morphine antagonsits. Cytidine and thymidine closely related in structure to deoxycytidine, are interchangeable with saline as controls, indicating a high degree of specificity in the receptor involved in the "action-effects" sequence. The requirement for deoxycytidine in countering the effects of morphine parallels the requirement for certain other DNA pyrimidines in the antagonism of barbiturate and alcohol. The rapidity of antogonist action suggests that such a DNA species would presumably be localized in the synaptosome, at outer membrane or the synaptic junction.

ORF 12592 caused concentration-dependent inhibition of isoproterenol stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in sarcolemma-enriched membrane preparations of guinea-pig myocardium. Its potency was slightly less than that of d,l-propranolol. ORF 12592 did not stimulate basal enzyme activity, suggesting it to be devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. It produced no marked inhibition of basal activity, nor did it inhibit sodium fluoride stimulated enzyme activity, indicating that the compound acts at the receptor rather than the catalytic site of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex. ORF 12592 competed for binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol to specific beta1 and beta2-adrenergic binding sites on turkey and leopard frog erythrocyte membranes respectively. Concentration-binding inhibition curves indicated that ORF 12592 is a non-selective beta-blocker with slightly less affinity for each beta-adrenergic receptor than propranolol.

Isolated vas deferens preparations from 9 dogs were subjected to electrical stimulation and chemical excitation under physiological conditions. The experimental smooth muscle cylinders were confined to the terminal 3 cm portions of either the distal 'urethral' segment or the proximal 'epididymal' segment. Intermittent field stimulation, at 60 sec intervals, was provided by a stimulator of low output impedance under constant parameters of frequency and voltage and an occasionally varied pulse width. Results from this examination completely confirmed the following: (i) a high degree of contractile sensitivity to minute doses of noradrenaline (0.03--0.03 micron; 10(-8)-10(-7) g/ml) and tyramine 0.58 micron (10(-7) g/ml; (ii) an apparent ease and rapidity of extinguishing the electrically-induced twitches by either small doses of phentolamine 0.25 micron (10(-7) g/ml) or phenoxybenzamine 5.8 micron (2 x 10(-6) g/ml); (iii) a complete absence of any inhibitory action by tyramine or noradrenaline on the electrically-induced twitches. The behavior of this motor transmission of the longitudinal muscle of the vas deferens to classical alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents and the intense susceptibility to the motor actions of the putative neurotransmitter clearly fit in with a picture of an adrenergic implication in this mode of transmission.

The role of anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms in the genesis of pneumonia or lung abscess in patients with historical, clinical, and radiologic findings suggestive of aspiration was compared to their role in similar patients without these findings. Bacterial specimens were obtained by transtracheal aspiration or thoracentesis. Anaerobes were isolated in 100% of the patients who were aspiration-prone as contrasted with only 20% of those who were not. Isolation of a single species or no growth was more common in the nonaspiration group, whereas multiple isolates were more common in the aspiration group. Patients with lung abscesses were treated with penicillin and all of them responded clinically, despite occasional recovery from the culture specimen of penicillin-resistant organisms. This suggests that lung abscess may be the result of a synergistic bacterial infection.

The Automated Military Outpatient System (AMOS) Project was developed to improve the ambulatory care of patients with episodic and chronic illnesses. During the development of its episodic care component, the relative frequency of problems treated by the walk-in clinic staff was analyzed and showed a high volume of acute minor illnesses. A simple, conservative triage system run by non-professionals was developed to screen patients to a clinic for benign, self-limited illnesses run by physician-extenders. This group, the equivalent of civilian licensed practical nurses and nurses' aides, was trained in a task-oriented fashion to treat 44 common minor illnesses. Clinical algorithms for these illnesses were developed and used as training tools, memory aids, and auditing instruments. This program is now operating in 26 US Army hospitals and caring for some 44,000 patients a month in the continetal United States. We report the results of a prospective audit of the corpsmen and a study of the patient attitude and acceptance of the program.

Of two patients with hyperparathyroidism, one had an associated chemodectoma, and the other had a thymoma and myasthenia gravis. There is a possible relationship to the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.

Both a low pleural fluid glucose concentration and pleural fluid acidosis are markers of severe pleural inflammation, but the relationship between these phenomena has not been defined clearly. Therefore, we measured simultaneous pleural fluid glucose concentrations and pH in 25 consecutive parapneumonic pleural fluids. Seventeen effusions had a glucose concentration greater than 60 mg/dl (group 1, 126 +/- 7 mg/dl, mean +/- SEM), while eight had a pleural fluid glucose less than 60 mg/dl (group 2, 15 +/- 3 mg/dl, P less than .01). Pleural fluid pH was 7.35 +/- 0.03 in group 1 compared with 6.83 +/- 0.09 in group 2 (P less than .01). A significant correlation between pleural fluid glucose and pH was found (r = .81, P less than .01). Low-glucose, low-pH effusions were complicated (either loculated or empyemas). Uncomplicated effusions had glucose concentrations greater than 60 mg/dl and a pleural fluid pH greater than 7.30. The concomitant occurrence of low pleural fluid glucose and pH suggests that the mechanisms leading to these phenomena are interrelated.

Having observed 18 cases, the authors describe a syndrome of recurrent paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia which was very homogeneous from the clinical and ECG point of view. It was usually found in middle aged males, with no demonstrable underlying heart disease, whose disorder of intra-atrial conduction occurred during sinus rhythm. The condition developed slowly over the course of years towards a maximum incidence of several short daily attacks of an arrhythmia which alternated between an atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Vagal overactivity is the precipitating cause of these attacks which are usually not completely nocturnal. The condition never progressed to sino-atrial block nor to permanent fibrillation. The beginning of each attack, often heralded by atrial coupling with a long enough interval to cause re-entry, is accompanied by slowing of the sinus rate down to the threshold level. The vagal effect of shortening the action potential and refractory period is recognised to be non-homogeneous in the atrial wall, and suggests a re-entry mechanism rather than hyper-excitability. This would explain the usual resistance of atrial arrhythmias of vagal origin to digitalis, beta blockers and quinidine. Amiodarone alone is usually effective because of the prolongation of the action potential which it causes. In 5 particularly resistant cases a good clinical result was obtained by the insertion of an atrial pacemaker with a fairly rapid rate.

This survey covers 786 children admitted with acute poisoning to the Saint-Pierre Hospital in Brussels between 1967 and 1976. The type and the frequency of products responsible for poisoning in the indigenous and immigrant children are compared. 45% of children admitted to hospital are immigrants but they constitute only 29% of the children admitted with poisoning. When compared with Belgian children, the immigrants more commonly ingest household products and ordinary drugs are taken more often than prescribed ones, but minor tranquillisers are particularly common. The socio-economic and psychologic factors responsible for these accidents are discussed and methods of prevention are suggested.

A number of immunological and non-immunological techniques have been recently used to detect soluble microbial substances in body fluids of patients with acute meningitis, bacteremia, and lobar pneumonia. By the immunological methods capsular highly polymerized polisaccharide group- or type-specific antigens of the most common C. N. S. pathogens (N. meningitidis A, B, and C; Str. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type b, E. coli K1, mucoid Pseudomonas, Cryptococcus neoformans) can be detected and quantitated in spinal fluids, sera, urine and other fluids specimens from meningitic patients. Capsular type-specific antigens from pneumococcus, and likely from H. influenzae as well, can be detected in sputum from patients with lower respiratory infection. Among the various techniques, the radioimmunoassay appears as the most sensitive one, but high diagnostic sensitivity can be also achieved by using the latex agglutination, haemoagglutination inhibition and coagglutination tests. Counterimmunoelectrophoresis, however, is still the far most used technique for determining soluble microbial antigens, albeit its sensitivity is significantly less than the one of the above mentioned methods. High specificity and some advantages in serotyping the causal organisms are probably the main reasons of such preferential employment. Among the non-immunological techniques the evaluation of lactate and lactic dehydrogenase has been used by some Author for differentiating between bacterial and non bacterial meningitis, and the limulus test for detecting Gram-negative bacterial endotoxins with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Finally, the liquid gas chromatography has been evaluated in detection of some organic products (microbial?), such as acids, amines, neutral compounds, in spinal fluid, allowing the differential diagnosis between bacterial, tuberculous, viral, and cryptococcal meningitis. In the present review sensitivity, specificity, and other properties of each test alone and in comparison with the conventional microbiological methods (Gram and culture) are evaluated and the biological and pathogenic role and significance of the soluble microbial antigens and endotoxin are discussed.

It is possible that some "postpsychotic depressions" may be a toxic effect of antipsychotic drugs. Out of a total of 94 schizophrenic patients, 28 developed a mild akinesia and 32 never developed extrapyramidal symptoms. Those who developed akinesia became less psychotic, but they also experienced a significant, although modest, increase in depression ratings. Successful treatment of the akinesia resulted in significant improvements in depression, somatic concern, anxiety, emotional withdrawal, blunted affect, and motor retardation on both physicians' and nurses' ratings. A high association between akinesia and both objectively rated and subjectively experienced sedative effect indicates that an 'akinetic depression' is not likely if the patient does not look or feel drowsy. The 32 nonakinetic patients also became less psychotic, but not more depressed.

Forty two patients (22 adults and 20 children or adolescents) with cerebral dysrithmia were included in a therapeutic trial using barbexaclone: 28 patients suffered from grand mal crises, 2 had associated GM and petit mal and 12 showed disturbances of behaviour without clinical crises. The patients were observed from 6 to 13 months. Four patients failed to complete the trial due to various side effects; 25 patients with GM and 11 with behaviour disturbances showed a very good response; two patients with associated petit mal failed to show any improvement. Side effects such as insomnia and irritability were seen in 8 patients. The authors concluded that barbexaclone is an excellent therapeutic agent in the treatment of grand mal and in patients with behaviour disturbances without convulsive crises.

Denture cleansers are ubiquitous compounds frequently found in the household. Experimental studies were carried out to investigate the caustic, chemical, and histopathological properties of Polident and Efferdent tablets and Ansodent powder. All products were found to have caused severe focal to diffuse caustic burns of the esophagus due to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide that was liberated by these compounds.

An acute test was run on healthy volunteers to assess the effect of i.v. dihydroergocristine methansulphonate on platelet function. The number of platelets was virtually unaffected, whereas adhesion to glass was significantly reduced. A direct and specific effect was noted on the 1st, adrenaline aggregation wave, while the 2nd wave (expression of ADP) induced aggregation did not appear to have been significantly altered. It is felt that further examination of the alpha-adrenergic block induced by the drug should be under-taken in view of the recent literature data which explain the inability of commonly employed anti-aggreganting drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid, to prevent and treat atherothrombosis, in spite of the encouraging experimental results.

Urine volume, urine pH, and urine glucose concentration were monitored for up to 24 hours after physiological saline or one of two dosage levels (0.22 mg/kg or 0.44 mg/kg) of xylazine was administered to cows. During the first 2 hours after xylazine was given, urine output was greatly increased (relative to the control animals), with the high dosage group having more output than the low dosage group. The influence of the drug on urine volume had ended by 5 hours after injection when urine output in both dosage groups had returned to that of the control group. Glucose was detected in the urine of xylazine treated animals, beginning at 15 to 30 minutes after injection, reached a maximum at 2 hours, and was undetectable at 5 to 6 hours. Urine pH decreased in control and treated animals, but in treated animals the pH began to increase 2 hr after treatment.

The effects of exchangeable ions and pH on the efflux of pyruvate from preloaded mitochondria are reported. Efflux obeys first-order kinetics, and the stimulation of efflux by exchangeable ions such as acetoacetate and lactate obeys Michaelis--Menten kinetics. The apparent Km value +/- S.E. for acetoacetate was 0.56 +/- 0.14 mM (n = 5) and that for lactate 12.3 +/- 2.3 mM (n = 6). The Vmax. values +/- S.E. at 0 degrees C were 16.2 +/- 2.0 and 21.9 +/- 2.7 nmol/min per mg of protein. The exchange of a variety of other substituted monocarboxylates was also studied. Efflux was also stimulated by increasing the external pH. The data gave a pK for the transport process of 8.35 and a Vmax. of 3.31 +/- 0.14 nmol/min per mg. The similarity of the Vmax. values for various exchangeable ions but the difference of this from the Vmax. in the absence of exchangeable ions may indicate that transport of pyruvate occurs with H+ and not in exchange for an OH- ion. The inhibition of transport by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate took several seconds to reach completion at 0 degrees C. It is proposed that inhibition occurs by binding to the substrate site and subsequent reaction with an -SH group on the inside of the membrane. The inhibitor can be displaced by substrates that can also enter the mitochondria independently of the carrier and so compete with the inhibitor for the substrate-binding site on the inside of the membrane. A mechanism for transport is proposed that invokes a transition state of pyruvate involving addition of an -SH group to the 2-carbon of pyruvate. Evidence is presented that suggests that ketone bodies may cross the mitochondrial membrane either on the carrier or by free diffusion. The physiological involvement of the carrier in ketone-body metabolism is discussed. The role of ketone bodies and pH in the physiological regulation of pyruvate transport is considered.

Chromaffin granules isolated from bovine adrenal gland were incubated with (3)H-labelled nucleotides and [(14)C]noradrenaline to study the uptake of these substances. [(3)H]ATP, [(3)H]ADP and [(3)H]AMP are taken up by these organelles by the same temperature-dependent mechanism. The apparent K(m) for ATP and ADP is 1.4mm, and for AMP it is 2.9mm. The uptake of ATP has a flat pH optimum, whereas the catecholamine uptake increases with more alkaline pH. Atractyloside and carboxyatractyloside are competitive and specific inhibitors of nucleotide uptake, whereas reserpine inhibits only that for catecholamines. Mg(2+) ions activate uptake of both catecholamine and nucleotides, whereas EDTA and N-ethylmaleimide inhibit these processes. Nucleotide and catecholamine uptakes are inhibited by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and by two ATP analogues. NH(4) (+) ions and nigericin in the presence of KCl inhibit only catecholamine uptake. It is concluded that nucleotide uptake, as proposed previously for catecholamine uptake, depends on an electrochemical proton gradient produced by a proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase localized in the membrane of chromaffin granules. Furthermore, as suggested by the effect of NH(4) (+) and nigericin, catecholamine uptake apparently depends on the chemical part of this gradient, whereas the results for nucleotide uptake are consistent with its dependence on the electrical component.

Glucagon treatment of rats allowed the isolation of liver mitochondria with enhanced rates of pyruvate metabolism measured in either sucrose or KCl media. No change in the activity of the pyruvate carrier itself was apparent, but under metabolizing conditions, use of the inhibitor of pyruvate transport, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, demonstrated that pyruvate transport limited the rate of pyruvate metabolism. The maximum rate of transport under metabolizing conditions was enhanced by glucagon treatment. Problems involved in measuring the transmembrane pH gradient under metabolizing conditions are discussed and a variety of techniques are used to estimate the matrix pH. From the distribution of methylamine, ammonia and D-lactate and the Ki for inhibition by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate it is concluded that the matrix is more acid than the medium and that the pH of the matrix rises after glucagon treatment. The increase in matrix pH stimulates pyruvate transport. The membrane potential, ATP concentration and O2 uptake were also increased under metabolizing conditions in glucagon-treated mitochondria. These changes were correlated with a stimulation of the respiratory chain which can be observed in uncoupled mitochondria [Yamazaki (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7924--7930]. The mitochondrial Mg2+ content (mean +/- S.E.M.) was increased from 38.8 +/- 1.2 (n = 26) to 47.5 +/- 2.0 (n = 26) ng-atoms/mg by glucagon and the K+ content from 126.7 +/- 10.3 (n = 19) ng-atoms/mg. This may represent a change in membrane potential induced by glucagon in vivo. The physiological significance of these results in the control of gluconeogenesis is discussed.

Kinetics of vitamin D-depleted and -repleted rat liver microsomal cholecalciferol 25-hydroxylase were studied. Anaerobiosis, CO, omission of a NADPH-generating system and addition of detergents all decreased the activities, showing that the hydroxylase behaves like a cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme. An apparent Km of 0.18 micrometer and Vmax. of 32pmol/min per g of tissue were found for vitamin D-deficient animals. Although both apparent Km and Vmax. were significantly altered in vitamin D-repleted animals no inhibition of the enzyme was elicited. These latter results show that at normal vitamin D intake, rat liver cholecalciferol 25-hydroxylase is not feedback-inhibited.

1. To gain insight into a putative role for mitochondria in silicon metabolism, mitochondrial uptake (by which it is meant the removal from the medium) of silicic acid [Si(OH)4] was studied under conditions minimizing SI(OH)4 polymerization. 2. Measurements of mitochondrial respiration and swelling indicated indirectly a significant uptake of Si(OH)4 as a weak acid, but this was not confirmed when 31Si(OH)4 was used as a tracer. 31Si(OH)4 occupied a mitochondrial volume similar to that of 3H2O and was relatively unaffected by mitochondrial energy status and by the pH gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. 3. Uptake was directly proportional to Si(OH)4 concentration in the range 0-3 mM. 4. The uptake consisted of two components: under all conditions examined, the greater quantity, amounting to 1-2nmol of Si(OH)4/mg of mitochondrial protein, was bound, a major portion of it external to the inner membrane, with the lesser quantity free within the matrix space. 5. Equilibration of 31Si(OH)4 between medium and matrix was a slow process, having a half-time of approx. 10 min at 22 degrees C. 6. Mersalyl and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the uptake by preferentially lowering the amount of Si(OH)4 bound. Their action was somewhat variable, depending on the precise nature of the suspending medium, and suggesting that the bound material may represent polymerized forms of Si(OH)4. 7. It is concluded that Si(OH)4 may penetrate the mitochondrial inner membrane by a simple diffusion mechanism.

The allosteric model for ribonuclease activity by Walker, Ralston & Darvey [(1975) Biochem.J. 147, 425--433; (1976) Biochem.J. 153, 329--337] involves the binding of a large number of molecules of substrate or substrate analogue to a series of allosteric sites on the enzyme. In the present paper, the nature of these allosteric interactions is investigated. The effects of ionic strength pH carbamoylation of lysine to homocitrulline and of deamidation of glutamine and asparagine on plots of velocity versus substrate concentration are examined and evidence is presented that the allosteric transition involves an electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged substrate molecules and the cationic groups on the enzyme.

1. It is proposed that periodate oxidation of glycol groups in the repeating units of polysaccharide molecules can be used to probe differences in polymer shapes in solution. 2. Measurement of second-order rate constants (k2) of periodate-glycol reactions may be compared between polymers and relevant monomers, to assess perturbations due to polymer configuration. 3. Factors effecting the measurement and interpretation of k2 are discussed. Over-oxidation, free-radical side reactions, end-group effects, Donnan equilibria and polymer (or molecular-weight) effects are relevant, but their importance is either small or can be minimized in practice. 4. A small group of glycosaminoglycuronans (chondroitin 4- and 6-sulphates and hyaluronate) are oxidized 50--100 times more slowly than three other glycosaminoglycuronans of similar composition, relevant monomers or three homopolyuronides. 5. A stable configuration in solution is postulated for the periodate-resistant polymers, involving carboxylate, acetamido and hydroxy groups in hydrogen-bonded sequences on alternate sides of the molecule. The more easily oxidizable polyuronides are unable to form this configuration. 6. The effect of temperature on the postulated configuration is investigated through the Arrhenius plot of k2, measured to hyaluronate, chondroitin 6-sulphate and methyl 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. Probable transitions at high (around 90 degrees C) temperatures were observed for both polymers, with an additional transition at about 37 degrees C in the case of hyaluronate. 7. L-Iduronic acid can take up different conformations depending on the polymer environment.

1. By using Bio-Gel A1.5M and Sephadex G-150 columns, crude cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli were fractionated to demonstrate the existence of a proline-biosynthetic aggregate. 2. Sephadex G-150 resolves two glutamyl kinases that are inhibited by proline, with mol.wts. of 125000 and 38000, the reactions of which are Mg2+-dependent. The heavier species is more sensitive to inhibition by proline. 3. Gamma-Glutamyl phosphate reductase and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (EC 1.5.1.2) have mol.wts. of approx. 125000 and 190000 respectively, the specific activity of the latter being 5 X 10(3)-fold greater than either of the other two biosynthetic enzymes or of the total pathway in vivo. 4. Bio-Gel A1.5M chromatography gave a single glutamyl kinase of mol.wt. 250000, and the possibility of this being a constituent of an enzyme complex is discussed.

Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase specifically carboxymethylated on cysteine-46 (a ligand to the zinc in the active site) or acetimidylated on 25 of the 30 lysine residues per subunit (including residue 228) was studied. The tryptophan fluorescence of these enzymes decreased by 35% as pH was increased, with an apparent pKa of 9.8 +/- 0.2, identical with that of native enzyme. Native enzyme in the presence of 30mM-imidazole, which displaces a water molecule ligated to the zinc, also had a pKa of 9.8. The ionoizable group is thus neither the water molecule nor one of the modified groups. Binding of NAD+ shifted the pKa for the fluorescence transition to 7.6 with native enzyme and to 9.0 with acetimidylated enzyme, but did not shift the pKa of carboxymethylated enzyme. Binding of NAD+ and trifluoroethanol, an unreactive alcohol, gave maximal fluorescence quenching at pH7 with all three enzymes. The acetimidylated enzyme--NAD+--trifluoroethanol complex had an apparent pKa of 5.0, but the pK of the native enzyme complex was experimentally inaccessible. The results are interpreted in terms of coupled equilibria between two different conformational states. On binding of NAD+, the modified enzymes apparently change conformation less readily than does native enzyme, but binding of alcohol can drive the change to completion.

1. The solubilization and partial purification of a proteinase from the intestinal smooth muscle of rats fed on protein-free diets are described. 2. It has a mol.wt. of about 33000 and it is stable over a narrow pH range. 3. From its susceptibility to known modifers of proteolytic enzymes, it appears to be a serine proteinase of a trypsin-like nature. Active-site titration with soya-bean trypsin inhibitor shows that the concentration of proteinase was about 3 microgram/g wet wt. of intestinal smooth muscle. However, the muscle proteinase demonstrates a marked ability for inactivating enzymes in their native conformation at neutral pH. It is about 100 times more efficient than pancreatic trypsin when the inactivating activities are compared on an approximately equimolar basis. 4. Inactivation of the substrate enzymes is accompanied by limited proteolysis, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. 5. An endogenous inhibitor was separated from the proteinase by fractionation with (NH4)2SO4. 6. Contamination of the muscle tissue by lumen, mucosal or blood proteinases and inhibitors is shown to be unlikely. 7. A role for the neutral trypsin-like proteinase in initiating the degradation of intracellular enzymes is considered.

Some properties of rat brain phenol sulphotransferase were investigated in in vitro at pH7.4. The enzyme was purified 10-fold by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex -50. It can be assayed with 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethylene glycol or 4-methylumbelliferone as the sulphate acceptor. The partially purified enzyme is stable for at least 1 week when stored at 4 degrees C. It is, however, additionally activated (10--20%) and stabilized by 1 mM-dithiothreitol. The activity of the enzyme does not depend on the addition of exogenous Mg2+. The pH optima for the sulphation of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethylene glycol and 4-methylumbelliferone are 7.8 and 7.4 respectively. Substrate inhibition by the sulphate acceptor is apparent at concentrations over 0.05mM. Initial-velocity studies in the absence and presence of product and dead-end inhibitors suggested that the mechanism of the rat brain sulphotransferase reaction is sequential ordered Bi Bi with a dead-end complex of enzyme with adenosine 3',5'-biphosphate and sulphate acceptor. The sulphate donor adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-sulphatophosphate is the first substrate that adds to the enzyme, and the sulphate acceptor is the second substrate. The dissociation constant for the complex of enzyme with sulphate donor is 21 micron. The sulphated substrate is the first product and adenosine 3',5'-biphosphate is the second product that leaves the enzyme.

Reaction of phenylglyoxal with glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.4), but not with glutamate synthase (EC 2.6.1.53), from Bacillus megaterium resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity. NADPH alone or together with 2-oxoglutarate provided substantial protection from inactivation by phenylglyoxal. Some 2mol of [14C]Phenylglyoxal was incorporated/mol of subunit of glutamate dehydrogenase. Addition of 1mM-NADPH decreased incorporation by 0.7mol. The Ki for phenylglyoxal was 6.7mM and Ks for competition with NADPH was 0.5mM. Complete inactivation of glutamate dehydrogenase by butane-2,3-dione was estimated by extrapolation to result from the loss of 3 of the 19 arginine residues/subunit. NADPH, but not NADH, provided almost complete protection against inactivation. Butane-2,3-dione had only a slight inactivating effect on glutamate synthase. The data suggest that an essential arginine residue may be involved in the binding of NADPH to glutamate dehydrogenase. The enzymes were inactivated by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and this inactivation increased 3--4-fold in the borate buffer. NADPH completely prevented inactivation by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate.

Dimeric creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) from rabbit skeletal muscle can be immobilized via a single subunit to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and subsequently treated with guanidine hydrochloride followed by renaturation to yield a catalytically active matrix-bound subunit derivative. The importance of the intact dimeric structure in the activation of the enzyme by acetate was demonstrated. Immobilization did not appear to alter the pH optimum of the enzyme, and the kinetic parameters fot the matrix-bound derivatives were generally similar to those for the soluble enzyme, but the matrix-bound derivatives showed higher thermal stability and greater resistance to denaturation than did the soluble enzyme. The rates of reaction of thiol groups of the matrix-bound derivatives with iodoacetamide in the absence and in the presence of combinations of substrates were similar to those of the soluble enzyme. Studies with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and with iodoacetamide revealed the presence of an additional reactive thiol group in the matrix-bound subunit derivative, which is presumably masked in the dimeric derivatives.

Malate synthase (EC 4.1.3.2) from dark-grown Euglena gracilis was purified to homogeneity by the criterion of polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was released from acetate-grown cells by treatment with ultrasonic waves and purified from broken-cell suspensions by high-speed centrifugation and (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, followed by gel-filtration on Sepharose 6B. The final enzyme preparation was purified 190-fold compared with the crude extract. The mol.wt. of the enzyme was about 350000 as determined by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B. Treatment with sodium dodecyl sulphate and urea dissociated the enzyme into subunits of mol.wt. 175000. The pH optimum for the enzyme was 8.0 and the Km values for glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA were 50 and 80 micron respectively. Antibodies raised to the purified enzyme were shown to be monospecific by radiochemical immunoassay. Euglena anti-(malate synthase) tested on Ouchterlony double-diffusion gels gave a sharp precipitation band against acetate-grown Escherichia coli, but no immunological correspondence was observed with acetate-grown Chlorella fusca, Zea mays (maize) scutella or purified malate synthase from Ricinus communis.

The effect of daily intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg of high molecular levan for 4-6 weeks on a number of physiological parameters was studied in rabbits. The parameters studied included whole blood pH, blood gases and acid-base balance. Control rabbits were similarly treated with physiological saline. In five rabbits T-50 was determined after levan treatment. None of the studied parameters was significantly affected by the levan treatment.

Cerebral vasospasm, cerebral metabolism and the acid-base-balance of blood and cerebrospinal fluid of dogs were studied during  and after the experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced by infusion of fresh blood into the basal cistern through a small sraniectomy in the base of the skull. Eighty adult mongrel dogs were used. Of these a complete recording was obtained in 32 cases under the constant controlled ventilation. The samples of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained repeatedly at the inserted 1 to 3 hours from the Polyethylene tube inserted into the cisterna magna subarachnoid space, carotid artery and internal jugular vein. During these procedures, the luminal size of the intracranial basal artery was measured angiographically. Vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries in response to experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage had a biphasic course, an acute phase (the vasoconstrictive phenomenon which lasts less than 6 hours) and chronic phase (the revasoconstriction occured and continued more than 24 hours after the hemorrhage). The former was named "Released Group" which consists of 16 dogs and the later was named "Prolonged Group" which consists of 20 dogs. In both group, pH and bicarbonate ion concentration of CSF were found to be reduced by twenty percent of the normal value on the aveaage about three hours after subarachnoid hemorrage, apparently reflecting occurence of early cerebral vasospasm. Remarkable metabolic acidosis was seen in CSF of the prolonged group as compared with in cerebral blood. The occurrence of A-V shunt was suggested in the cerebral circulation from the blood gas findings. The experimental results indicates that prolonged cerebral vasospams phenomenon causes persistent hypoxic state in the cerebral tissue. However, cellular metabolism of cerebral tissue will be probably maintained by oxygen supply necessary to cellular respiration through the blood-brain barrier from the cerebrospinal fluid.

The effects of pH, acetimidate concentration, temperature, and reaction time of methyl acetimidate with sperm whale myoglobulin have been assessed. Reaction at pH 9.8 and 15 degrees C for 30 min with a sixfold excess of methyl acetimidate relative to each amino group yielded six acetimidomyoglobin derivatives which were separated and purified. Reaction with tetrahydrophthalic anhydride revealed the number of amino groups that remained unreacted in each separated component and made possible further subractionation. Modification at the NH2 terminus was quantitated by automated stepwise Edman degradation. The acetimidyl and tetrahydrophthalyl groups, were readily removable. The potentiometric titration of three of the completely deprotected components showed identity with the parent untreated sperm whale myoglobin. The first of two major products was acetimidated at all 19 epsilon-amino groups but not at the NH2 terminus. The second major product bore a blocked NH2 terminus but retained one unmodified epsilon-amino group, identified after modification by trinitrobenzenesulfonate as lysine residue 77. Of the minor components, one was identified as completely acetimidated at all 20 amino groups. The other three minor components appeared to contain irreversible by-products.

Upon oxidation of D-propargylglycine by D-amino acid oxidase, the enzyme is converted by covalent alkylation to catalytic species with different properties from those of native enzyme. At least five distinct modified enzyme species are present in the preparation, as determined by gel electro-focusing. Individual characterization of the components has not yet been attempted. The combined kinetic and spectral properties of the preparation have been studied. The modified enzymes have a marked preference for hydrophobic amino acids: the rates of oxidation decrease in the series D-phenylalanine, D-methionine, D-norleucine, D-norvaline, D-alpha-aminobutyrate, D-alanine. In addition, the observed Kms of the amino acids are increased, especially those of the smaller substrates (D-alanine and D-alpha-aminobutyrate). A primary kinetic isotope effect is observed upon oxidation of amino acids by the modified enzymes, evidence that this catalysis exhibits a different rate-determining step from catalysis by native enzyme. The modified apoenzyme exhibits intense absorbance at 318--320 nm, not present in native enzyme. This chromophore can be partially (75%) removed by treatment of the modified enzyme with hydrazine. However, the activity of native enzyme is not substantially restored by this process, suggesting the existence of superficial alkylations in addition to the modification responsible for the observed changes in kinetic parameters.

The ATP-dependent uptake of H+ by hog gastric parietal cell vesicles was quantitated by using the pH indicator dyes bromcresol green and malachite green, the weak bases, aminopyrine and 9-aminoacridine, and the pH electrode. A K+-dependent H+ uptake was found, with a significant difference between the quantity of H+ disappearing from the medium (deltaHo) and the quantity appearing inside the vesicle (deltaHi). 9-Aminoacridine gave a lower value for the deltaHi than any of the other probes. Probes of potential such as diethyloxadicarbocyanine or oxonol dyes showed that only secondary diffusion potentials occurred during H+ uptake and that the cationic dyes in the presence of protonophores could also be used to quantitate H+ uptake. The potential in the presence of protonophore indicated a deltaHi greater than that found with the other probes. Binding sites for acridine orange were generated either by ATP or an artificial pH gradient and corresponded to the deltaHi indicated by aminopyrine. SCN- (30mM) only partially inhibited the H+ gradient, and this, coupled with the failure to detect the physiological deltapH of 6.6, indicated that these vesicles may be an incomplete model of gastric acid secretion.

Both activities of the aspartokinase--homoserine I (AK-HSD) of Escherichia coli are inhibited by threonine. Careful threonine binding studies have now been done which have allowed us to distinguish the various effects of threonine on the enzyme. The ultrafiltration technique of H. Paulus ((1969) Anal. Biochem. 32, 101) for measuring ligand binding was shown to be comparable with equilibrium dialysis techniques. Reduction in error by utilization of this procedure enabled us to obtain evidence for two different sets of threonine sites by direct binding studies. The binding data were mathematically consistent with two independent classes of threonine sites, each of which contained four sites per tetramer and had a Hill coefficient of about 2.3--2.5. KD for the second set of sites was five- to tenfold greater than the high affinity sites, depending upon conditions. The data now suggest that the sequential model for site--site interactions adequately describes the cooperativity of threonine binding to the high affinity set of sites.

Ethidium bromide, a new type of inhibitor of energy transduction in oxidative phosphorylation, inhibited ATP synthesis in intact mitochondria but not in submitochondrial particles, the latter being inside-out relative to the membranes of intact mitochondria. Ethidium bromide incorporated inside the submitochondrial particles inhibited ATP synthesis in the particles. The decrease of the membrane potential by valinomycin (plus KCl) inhibited only slightly the energy-dependent binding of ethidium bromide to the mitochondria. The present results show clearly that ethidium bromide inhibited energy transduction in oxidative phosphorylation by acting on the outer side (C-side) of the inner mitochondrial membrane, perhaps by neutralizing negative charges created on the surface of the C-side, and that it had no inhibitory activity on the inner side (M-side) of the membrane. Th present results show also that the energy-dependent binding of ethidium is not due to electrophoretic transport down the membrane potential; ethidium may bind to negative charges on the surface of the C-side. The present study suggest that an anisotropic distribution of electric charge in the inner mitochondrial membrane is an intermediary high energy state of oxidatvie phosphorylation.

Photoelectric properties of bacteriorhodopsin incorporated into a bimolecular lipid membrane were investigated with special regard to the mechanism of photoelectric field generation. It was shown that besides its proton pump and electric generator functions bacteriorhodopsin works as a possible molecular regulator of the light-induced membrane potential. When a bimolecular lipid membrane containing bacteriorhodopsin is continuously illuminated in its main visible absorption band, and afterwards by superimposed blue light matching the absorption band of the long-living photobleached bacteriorhodopsin (M412) as well, the latter either enhances or decreases the steady-state photoresponse, depending upon the intensity of the green light. Thus, the additional blue-light illumination tends to cause the resultant photoelectric membrane potential to become stabilized. Two alternative schemes are tentatively proposed for the photochemical cycle of bacteriorhodopsin whereby blue light can control photovoltage generation. A kinetic model of the proton pump and the regulation of the photoelectric membrane potential is presented. This model fits all the experimental findings, even quantitatively. From the model some kinetic and physical parameters of this light-driven pump could be determined.

The kinetics of the metarhodopsin I-II reaction have been measured over a wide range of temperatures (1-37C ) and pH values (4.5-8) with suspensions containing fragments of bovine rod outer segments. It was found that for all conditions the occurrence of metarhodopsin II could be described by two independent first-order processes. The fast component: slow component amplitude ratio depends upon pH and temperature. The kinetics of the lumi-metarhodopsin I reaction show the same pH dependence for the fast component: slow component amplitude ratio as the one observed for the metarhodopsin II signals. All the results observed could be described with the assumption that rhodopsin itself exists in two conformational states before bleaching which are in a pH and temperature-dependent equilibrium. This hypothesis is confirmed by its ability to explain some apparently anomalous observations in the literature.

Inside-out thylakoid vesicles have been separated from right-side-out material after press disruption of chloroplast lamellae. The sepration was obtained by partitionin an aqueous dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase system, a method which utilizes differences in surface properties for separation of membrane particles. The isolated thylakoid vesicles showed the following inside-out properties: (1) light-induced reversible proton extrusion into the surrounding medium when supplied with the Photosystem II electron acceptor phenyl-p-benzoquinone; (2) a pH rise in the internal phase accompanying the external proton release, (3) sensitivity to trypsin treatment different from that of thylakoid membranes of normal orientation; (4) concave EF and convex PF freeze-fracture faces.

4-Phenylspiro [furan-2(3H),1-phtalan]3,3'-dione (fluorescamine) was used to covalently modify amino groups of thylakoids. Subsequently its effect on parameters of energy transfer and phosphorylating activity was assessed. While electron transport, the extent of proton uptake, 515 nm change and 9-aminoacridine quench were relatively resistant to such treatment, the functions connected to coupling factor 1, namely ATP formation by acid/base transition, ATPase activity and photophosphorylation were  affected much earlier. Photophosphorylation appears to be the most sensitive. The data are interpreted as indicating an involvement of free amino groups in energy transfer.

The cytochromes c2 of the Rhodospirillaceae show a much greater variation in redox potential and its pH dependence than the mitochondrial cytochromes c that have been studied. It is proposed that the range of redox potential for cytochromes c2 functioning as the immediate electron donor to photo-oxidised bacteriochlorophyll may be 345-395 mV at pH 5. Closely related cytochromes c2 with different redox potentials show patterns of amino acid substitution which are consistent with changes in hydrophobicity near the haem being at least a partial determinant of redox potential. More distantly related cytochromes are difficult to compare because of the large number of amino acid substitutions and the probability that there are subtle changes in overall peptide chain folding. The redox potential versus pH curves can be analysed in terms of either one ionisation in the oxidised form or two in the oxidised form and one in the reduced. The pK in the oxidised form at higher pH values can be correlated with the pK for the disappearance or shift of the near infrared absorption band located near 695 nm. The structural bases of these ionisations are not known but the possible involvement of the haem propionate residues is discussed.

The influence of the pH on the stability and stoichiometry of the complexes formed by carboxylic-antibiotics such as grisorixin, alborixin and monensin with alkaline and alkaline earth cations has been investigated. The maximum values of bimolecular lipid membrane conductance are obtained with grisorixin and potassium ion. The conductance-pH curves show a very pronounced maximum in the neutral pH range. The results are analysed on the basis of a dimeric form of the ionophore in the complex and the possibility of having several charged complexes resulting from an heterogeneous reaction, the number of each complexed form depending on the pH of the bulk solutions.

We have purified an induced beta-D-glucosidase (beta-D-glucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.21) from Stachybotrys atra to apparent homogeneity. The induced enzyme was clearly different from the constitutive beta-D-glucosidase. The molecular weight was 65 500-69 000, the pH optimum was at 6.7 and the isoelectric point at 4.8. Carbohydrate content (related to glucose) was 14.4%. The enzyme showed beta-D-glucosidase, beta-D-xylosidase and beta-D-thioglucosidase activity. These three activities sppear to be due to the same enzyme. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by D-glucono-(1 leads to 5)-lactone and nojirimycin and was very sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents.

The catalytic properties of the two human trypsins obtained from purified trypsinogens have been studied. The catalytic rate constant kcat and the pK of the ionisable residue implicated in the active site have been determined with Bz-Arg-OEt. The hydrolysis of Tos-Arg-OMe by human trypsins does not follow the simple Michaelis-Menten scheme and indicates a difference in the conformational flexibility of the active site-regions of the two enzymes. Both enzyme are readily autolyzed and calcium ion plays a fundamental role in stabilizing trypsin activity. However trypsin 2 self-digests more rapidly than trypsin 1. These results are a prerequisite to the elucidation of the fate of pancreatic enzymes in human digestive tract.

A proteolytic enzyme, which causes the limited degradation of cardiac myosin, was purified from rat heart myofibrils. The purified enzyme (a myosin-cleaving protease) was apparently homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Autolysis of the purified enzyme was observed at neutral pH without high concentration of CaCl2. The molecular weight was estimated to be 26 000-27 000. The enzyme was active against casein, N-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester and N-glutaryl-L-phenylalanine-4-nitroanilide (Glu-Phe-NAn), but less active with N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-4-nitroanilide. Optimum pH values for the enzyme were 9.0 for casein and 8.4 for Glu-Phe-NAn. Caseinolytic activity of the enzyme was completely inhibited with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and diisopropylphosphofluoride and partially inhibited with L-1-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (Tos-PheCH2Cl) and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Tos-LysCH2Cl had no effect. Sulfhydryl reagents, metal-chelating agents and metal ions except for Zn2+ had little or no effect on the activity. Degradation of cardiac myosin with the enzyme produced two fragments having molecular weights of 130 000 and 94 000, accompanied by the disappearance of myosin heavy chain and light chain 2. Myosin degradation with the enzyme was more restrictive than with chymotrypsin.

Yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating), EC 1.2.1.12) immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4-B has been subjected to dissociation to obtain matrix-bound dimeric species of the enzyme. Hybridization was then performed using soluble glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isolated from rat skeletal muscle. Immobilized hybrid tetramers thus obtained were demonstrated to exhibit two distinct pH-optima of activity characteristic of the yeast and muscle enzymes, respectively. The results indicate that under appropriate conditions the activity of each of the dimers composing the immobilized hybrid tetramer can be studied separately.

Guanylate cyclase (GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.2) was purified 2250-fold from the synaptosomal soluble fraction of rat brain. The specific activity of the purified enzyme reached 41 nmol cyclic GMP formed per min per mg protein at 37 degrees C. In the purified preparation, GTPase activity was not detected and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity was less than 4% of guanylate cyclase activity. The molecular weight was approx. 480 000. Lubrol PX, hydroxylamine, or NaN3 activated the guanylate cyclase in crude preparations, but had no effect on the purified enzyme. In contrast, NaN3 plus catalase, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or sodium nitroprusside activated the purified enzyme. The purified enzyme required Mn2+ for its activity; the maximum activity was observed at 3-5 mM. Cyclic GMP activated guanylate cyclase activity 1.4-fold at 2 mM, whereas inorganic pyrophosphate inhibited it by about 50% at 0.2 mM. Guanylyl-(beta,gamma-methylene)-diphosphonate and guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, analogues of GTP, served as substrates of guanylate cyclase in the purified enzyme preparation. NaN3 plus catalase or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine also remarkably activated guanylate cyclase activity when the analogues of GTP were used as substrates.

A mechanism for the reduction and oxidation of methyl viologen by Clostridium pasteurianum hydrogenase (hydrogen:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, EC 1.12.7.1) is proposed. Double reciprocal plots for methyl viologen reduction and oxidation at pH values 7.0-9.85 are linear, and the plots for reduction and oxidation are intersecting. Such data are consistent with a mechanism in which the H2 and one methyl viologen bind (either in order or randomly) with subsequent reduction and release of the methyl viologen. A second methyl viologen then is bound, reduced and released. Comparison of the calculated Keq' with the Haldane expression in which both methyl viologens react at the same rate show a large difference. This difference indicates that the two methyl viologens react at different rates. Addition of oxidized electron carriers inhibits the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction (i.e., the exchange of protons between H2 and 2H2O). CO reversibly inhibits methyl viologen reduction and is competitive vs. H2. O2 acts as an irreversible inhibitor.

Esterase-9A, which appears electrophoretically as a triplet of the bands III-50, III-40 and III-30, was isolated from the kidneys of male NMRI-mice by isoelectrofocusing and refocusing followed by repeated molecular sieve chromography. The overall purification was approx. 250 fold and each of the three bands was isolated separately. The band of the triplet nearest to the cathode, III-50, changed in vitro into the satellite bands III-40 and III-30 and, further, into the band III-22 not observed before in the homogenate. It is assumed that the band III-50 represents the original gene product. The molecular weight (45 000) of the band III-50 is identical with those of III-40 and III-30, as measured by analytical electrophoresis, whereas the molecular weight obtained by thin-layer chromatography was 51 000. There were no obvious signs that esterase-9 was composed of subunits. The Km constant for 4-nitrophenyl proprionate was identical for each of three bands. The esterase-9A is the first testosterone-dependent isozyme of the mouse carboxylesterase (carboxylicester hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.1) system which has been isolated.

A homgenate of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown under semi-anaerobic as well as aerobic conditions was found to catalyze the hydrolysis of fatty acid esters of sterols in the presence of Triton X-100. The enzyme levels in cells grown under various conditions were similar and the enzyme had a broad substrate specificity for sterol esters. The enzyme was localized in the mitochondrial fraction for the aerobically grown cells and in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions for the semi-anaerobically grown cells.

Kinetic studies were made with 2 forms of immobilized acetylcholinesterase: enzyme trapped in polyacrylamide gel which was cut into slices; and enzyme attached to the inner surface of nylon tubing. Rates were measured at substrate concentrations which were low and high with reference to the Michaelis constant, and over the temperature range 16-40 degrees C. Low activation energies (1.7-2.7 kcal mol-1) were obtained at low substrate concentrations, indicating diffusion control. At high substrate concentrations the Arrhenius plots were non-linear and the activation energies substantially higher, and there is less diffusion control. With enzyme-polyacrylamide slices, there was a continuous increase in rate with increasing pH, in contrast to the bell-shaped behavior with free enzyme. A theoretical treatment suggests that this is due to the lowering of local pH as a result of the acid released in the hydrolysis.

The activity vs. pH profile for the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by purified cytochrome oxidase (ferrocytochrome c:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.9.3.1) was investigated as a function of ionic strength (from 10 to 200 mM) in the absence and in the presence of various perturbants: Tween 20, linear polyanions (RNA, heparin, polyglutamic acid) and phospholipids (asolectin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin). The activation induced by Tween 20 and "zero net charge" phospholipid liposomes was not pH dependent. On the other hand, linear polyanions and polyanionic liposomes strongly perturbed the pH profile, mostly at low ionic strength, by shifting the pH optimum about 1.7 pH units towards alkaline pH values. This effect was reversed by increasing ionic strength. These observations are interpreted in the light of polyelectrolyte theory. Since these results show striking with membrane-bound enzyme, it is concluded that in vivo cytochrome oxidase is located within polyanionic sites of the micochondrial membrane. The activation broght about by phospholipids may result from two posible processes: creation of a hydrophobic environment by the non-polar tails, preventing autoaggregation; and creation of a suitable polyelectrolytic environment by the polar heads (of non zero net charge), increasing the intrinsic reaction rate.

31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and enzymatic activities are compared for alkaline phosphatase (orthophosphoric-monoester phosphohydrolase (alkaline optimum), EC 3.1.3.1) species with different zinc contents. The enzyme containing two Zn2+ per protein dimer exists in two forms; one, prepared by dialysis of native enzyme, has full enzymatic activity and a 31P magnetic resonance spectrum similar to but distinguishable from that of the native enzyme containing four or more Zn2+. The other form, prepared by restoring two Zn2+ to apoenzyme, has low enzymatic activity and a 31P magnetic resonance spectrum that indicates stoichiometric binding of phosphate, but otherwise altered properties. Reconstituted enzyme with four Zn2+ is similar to but distinguishable from native enzyme with four Zn2+. Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose can separate apoenzyme and enzyme containing two Zn2+ and suggests that the binding of a pair of Zn2+ is cooperative.

At pH 5.5, sodium trifluoroacetate is a potent competitive inhibitor of porcine elastase (Ki = 2.6 mM) and human leukocyte elastase (Ki = 9.3 mM). For both enzymes the Ki increases strongly with pH. Sodium fluoride is inactive on pancreatic elastase and sodium acetate is a weak inhibitor of this enzyme. Trifluoroethanol inhibits both enzymes but is less active than trifluoroacetate in acidic pH conditions. Bovine trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin are resistant to the action of sodium trifluoroacetate and trifluoroethanol. The interaction between sodium trifluoroacetate and pancreatic elastase is  also demonstrated by 19F NMR spectroscopy. Trifluoroacetyltrialanine is able to displace trifluoroacetate from its complex with pancreatic elastase. In addition, a method using turkey ovomucoid for the active site titration of leukocyte and pancreatic elastase is described.

Guanine deaminase (guanine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.3) from pig brain was purified to homogeneity by column chromatography and ammonium sulphate fractionation. Homogeneity was established by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The molecular weight of 110 000 was determined by gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated subunits of a molecular weight of 50 000. The amino acid composition, the isoelectric point and the number of -SH groups were determined. 5.5'-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reacts with about seven -SH groups in the native enzyme, but upon denaturation with SDS, 10 -SH groups react with this former reagent. Using electrolytic reduction, 44 half-cystines were determined in accordance with the number of cysteic acid residues determined by amino acid analysis after performic acid oxidation. The Km values determined for substrates of the enzyme were 1.1 . 10(-5) M for guanine in 0.1 M Tris. HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 3.3 . 10(-4) M for 8-azaguanine in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.4. The pKa values determined for ionizable groups of the active site of the enzyme were near pH 6.2 and pH 8.2. The chemical and kinetic evidence suggests that cysteine and histidine may be essential for the catalysis.

The effect of hydrogen bonding on the transition energy and the oscillator strength of the isoalloxazine nucleus of flavins was studied by the molecular orbital method. Among the possible hydrogen bondings examined, characteristic spectral shifts were found for the hydrogen bondings at N(1) and N(5) of the nucleus. The hydrogen bonding at N(1) resulted in the shift of the first absorption band towards blue and that of the second one towards red. On the other hand, the hydrogen bonding at N(5) resulted in the shifts of both the first and the second band towards red. The spectral characteristics reported on Clostridium MP and Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxin coincided with the calculated results. The application of the calculated results to D-amino acid oxidase (D-amino acid: oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating), EC 1.4.3.3) led to the conclusion that hydrogen bonding occurs at O(12), N(3)H, O(14) and N(5) of the isoalloxazine nucleus. The occurrence of hydrogen bondings at O(12), N(3)H, and O(14) is favorable for N(5) of the isoalloxazine nucleus to accept electron from an electron donor.

A specific histidine decarboxylase from rat gastric mucosa has been obtained at high purity and good yield (purification about 600-fold). The purification procedure included double (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, ion-exchange chromatography, preparative isoelectric focusing in a granulated gel and gel filtration. Only the specific histidine enzyme was obtained by that procedure; DOPA decarboxylase, a non-specific enzyme, was absent in our final preparation. Each step of the purification was visualized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical isoelectric focusing. The purified enzyme was apparently homogenous by criteria of electrophoresis and gel filtration and has a molecular weight of 94 000. Several protein bands appeared after isoelectric focusing and the enzyme activity was localized in 3 distinct peaks. The gastric enzyme consists of 3 active forms which could be distinguished by their isoelectric points: 5.4, 5.75 and 6. Moleculare weights estimated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were 97 000, 93 000 and 90 000, and no subunits were observed. Pyridoxal phosphate was required as a coenzyme and resolution of the holoenzyme agreed with a portion of the coenzyme tightly bound to the apoenzyme. The purified enzyme was stable at low ionic strength, near neutral pH; concentrated reducing agents inhibit the enzyme.

A soluble form of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (NADH: ferricytochrome b5 oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.2.2) was found in the cytosolic fraction of rabbit liver. The partially purified enzyme was strictly specific for NADH. It catalyzed the reduction of several substrates such as the methemoglobin-ferrocyanide complex (Hegesh, E. and Avron, M. (1967) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 146, 91-101) (apparent Km: 8 micrometer), potassium ferricyanide (apparent Km: 10 micrometer) and ferricytochrome b5 (apparent Km: 15 micrometer). Upon acrylamide gel isoelectro-focusing followed by specific staining, the enzyme was resolved into four bands (isoelectric pH: 7.05, 6.70, 6.50 and 6.30). The optimum pH of activity with ferricytochrome b5 as a substrate was 6.5. The estimated molecular weight was 25 000--30 000. The enzyme was unsensitive to cyanide. It was strongly inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The cytosolic liver cytochrome b5 reductase was immunologically related to the soluble cytochrome b5 reductase from human and rabbit red-cells, and to the microsomal cytochrome b5 reductase from rabbit liver.

Glutathione peroxidase (glutathione:hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.9) was purified from rat liver mitochondria. The enzyme was shown to be pure by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and to contain multiple forms that differed in charge. Selenium was specifically associated with the enzyme. The enzyme was inhibited by iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamide in an unusual pattern of reduction by sulfhydryl compounds and pH dependency. The mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms of the enzyme were compared, and an explanation of the inhibition patterns is offered.

Harderian gland extracts from male rats catalyze the conversion of serotonin to N-acetylserotonin and of tryptamine to N-acetyltryptamine. The reaction is linear up to 14 mg tissue and departs from linearity after 10 min. The pH otpimum with tryptamine as substrate is between 8 and 9. Enzymic activity of the gland in vivo does not show diurnal variations. Enzymic activity of tissue in organ culture is not stimulated by 10 micrometer isoproterenol or 100 micrometer dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Harderian gland tissue in culture can acetylate tryptamine and serotonin and can O-methylate the N-acetylserotonin to form melatonin.

The properties of the triglyceride- and cholesteryl ester-hydrolyzing activity by an acid lipase from rabbit aortic tissue were compared under different experimental conditions. Radiolabeled cholesteryl oleate or triolein was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by sonication and the resulting preparations were used for in vitro studies. No distinction was observed between triglyceride lipase and cholesterol esterase activity in the aortic cytosol fraction following either thermal inactivation, inhibition by a mercurial, fractionation by ammonium sulfate or acid precipitation, or DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Addition of rabbit lipoproteins to the assay system resulted in inhibition of both cholesterol esterase and triglyceride lipase activity. Parallel changes in the hydrolysis of both substrates also were observed when exogenously added lipids were added to the incubation system in various physical states. Specificities of the enzyme system towards different cholesteryl esters were examined. No differences in the rate of hydrolysis were observed between cholesteryl oleate, palmitate and linoleate. The data suggest that a single acid lipase, presumably of lysosomal origin, has broad specificity towards triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and may play a role in the hydrolysis of these lipids during intralysosomal degradation of lipoproteins.

Conditions for the in vitro activation of the latent form of a protease-like permeability factor in the pseudoglobulin fraction from guinea pig skin were examined. (1) The factor was activated by dialysis against 67 mM phosphate buffer at pH 5.8--6.4, not at pH 7.0--8.0. (2) High salt concentration (200 mM or greater phosphate buffer or 67 mM phosphate buffer containing 200 mM or greater KCl or NaCl) prevented the activation at pH 6.2. (3) High osmotic pressure (sucrose at 1 M) did not affect activation at pH 6.2. (4) Reconversion of the activated permeability factor into an inactive form was not observed under high salt conditions, under which the latent permeability factor was stable in its own form. (5) The molecular size of the latent permeability factor was estimated as approx. 80 000 by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration at high salt concentration.

The mechanism of complexation of pI range 3.5--5 Ampholine to heparin in isoelectric focusing has been explored by the dye-binding technique at different pH values in solution. There is no significant interaction between heparin and Ampholine at pH 6.7. Weak, or selective, binding occurs at pH 5.1, and very strong interaction at pH 3.5. In the latter system, the Ampholine components appear to behave as polycations due to their ordered sequence of positive charges, each two methylene groups apart, which favors a strong binding to polyanions. In addition, there appear to be variable stoichiometries for the strong binding between heparin and Ampholine, depending on their relative amounts. It is proposed that at a low ratio of heparin to Ampholine (Ampholine excess), aggregation is perpendicular to the heparin chain, with the end ammonium charge of each Ampholine molecule neutralizing one negative charge along the heparin molecule; at higher ratios (heparin excess), the bound Ampholine segment is aligned parallel to the heparin molecule, so that on the average one Ampholine component neutralizes approx. three negative charges. The banding of heparin in isoelectric focusing in the pH range 3.0--4.5 can be explained by aggregation of the various components on heparin in amounts dependent upon the net charge on the Ampholine species at the given pH, and upon the changing stoichiometries as a function of the variation in ratio of heparin to Ampholine along the pH gradient. Binding of Ampholine to polygalacturonate was also demonstrated in excess Ampholine in a pH range dependent on the degree of protonation of the carboxyl groups of this acidic polysaccharide as well as on the net positive charge of the Ampholine. The aggregation seen at pH 4.2--4.5 led to the prediction and subsequent demonstration that polygalacturonate would also exhibit binding upon isoelectric focusing. This supports the hypothesis that aggregation of Ampholine on polyanions having sufficient charge density is a general phenomenon which can lead to spurious banding of certain polymers at appropriate pH ranges in isoelectric focusing. On the basis of their behavior in isoelectric focusing at pH 3.0--4.5, strength of aggregation of the polyanions studied appears to be heparin A = heparin B greather than polyglutamate greater than carboxyl-reduced heparin B greater than polygalacturonic acid.

Rat ventral prostate contains an acidic protein which can bind spermine selectively. The relative binding affinities of various aliphatic amines for the protein are, in decreasing order, spermine greater than thermine greater than greater than putrecine greater than 1,10-diaminodecane, cadaverine and 1,12-diaminododecane. The binding protein has an isoelectric point at pH 4.3 and a sedimentation coefficient of 3 S. Its molecular weight is approx. 30 000. Histones and nuclear chromatin preparations of the prostate can interact with the binding protein. The spermine-binding activity of the purified prostate protein can be inactivated by treatment with intestinal alkaline phosphatases. The phosphatase treated preparation can then be reactivated by beef heart protein kinase in the presence of cyclic AMP and ATP. The spermine-binding activity of the prostate cytosol protein fraction decreases after castration, but increases very rapidly after the castrated rats are injected with 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone. This finding raises the possibility that, in the postate, certain androgen actions may be dependent on the androgen-induced increase in the acidic protein binding of polyamines and their translocation to a functional cellular site such as nuclear chromatin. In the prostate cytosol, spermine also binds to 4-S tRNAs and to a unique RNA which has a sedimentation coefficient of 1.5 S.

Apparent Mg2+ and H+ stability constants of 5-phosphoribosyl alpha-1-pyrophosphate (ligand, L) complexes were determined from pH titration data at 25 degrees C with an average of 0.17 M NaCl or KCl and 0.20 M ionic strength. The logarithms of calculated macroscopic overall stability constants are: 3.2 (MgL3-), 4.8 (Mg2L-), 6.5 (HL4-), 12.4 H2L3-), 9.4 (Mg HL2-), and 11.0 (MgH2L). Comparison of the stepwise Mg2+ stability constants (log k = 3.2 and 1.6) with those of MgADP- and MgAMP or Mg-hexose-1-P suggests that the first and second Mg2+ bind to the 1-PP and 5-P groups of the ligand, respectively. Reasonable assumptions about relative microscopic constants indicate that several of the microscopic isomers do not achieve significant concentrations over a large range of conditions. Judging from other data on organophosphate complexes, it is likely that the constants of this study may be extrapolated with little error to other conditions of ionic strength 0.1--0.2 M) and temperature (e.g., 15--35 degrees C), and widely different monovalent ion concentrations.

An alkylating analogue of NADP+ the 3-chloroacetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate was prepared from 3-diazoacetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate which was obtained by enzymatic transglucosidation of NADP+. The 3-diazoacetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate proved to be more unstable when compared to the corresponding NAD+ analogue. The alkylation of several dehydrogenases using this alkylating analogue is mentioned.

Testosterone pretreatment (1.0-4.0 mg/kg) attenuated, in a dose-response fashion, the induction of stereotyped behavior and hyperactivity by pargyline (0.25, 4.0 mg/kg) and beta-phenylethylamine (8.0, 16.0 mg/kg) in preubertal, male rats. The dyskinetic movements induced by pargyline and beta-phenylethylamine were proposed as a possible animal model for tardive dyskinesias. Attenuation by testosterone of these effects suggested an hormonal involvement consistent with the reported predominant occurrence of tardive dyskinesias in women and in the elderly.

The capacity to differentiate and form colonies in vitro by bone marrow granulocytic precursor cells and its evolution were studied in eight cases of drug-induced acute agranulocytosis. In three cases colonies and clusters count were normal or high. These cases were probably immunological agranulocytosis. In the five other cases this number was very low and returned to normal from three to thirteen days. These were probably cases of marrow suppression by the drug.

A study was made of the lymphocytes obtained from 25 patients suffering from sarcoidosis as proved by the Kveim-Siltzbach test and/or organ biopsy. The number of T lymphocytes was determined by the E rosette technique and functional activity by a local xenogeneic graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) as well as skin tests with PPD, SK-SD, Candida and Trichophyton. In most cases the absolute number of T cells was low and there was an evident impairment of their functional activity. There was also a clear correlation between the severity of impairment of cell-mediated immunity and the clinical stage and activity of the disease. In vitro incubation of the lymphocytes with thymic humoral factor resulted in recovery of the functional activity of the T lymphocytes of 4 of the 7 patients tested, with the previously negative GVHR becoming positive. One of these patients was treated with thymic humoral factor with a resulting restoration of the cell-mediated immune response although there was no evident clinical improvement.

pH, C02 and buffer capacity of the brain and blood acid-base status were studied in (C) control and in acutely water depleted (WD) rats. WD rats developed a greater metabolic [H+] increase in brain than in blood. The results suggest that brain [H+] change is a primary metabolic reply to acute dehydration.

The thermal unfolding of alpha-lactalbumin has been studied by equilibrium measurements of aromatic difference spectra, and by kinetic measurements of the Joule heating temperature-jump. The unfolding at neutral pH is a reversible two-state transition. The equilibrium transition curves are analyzed by the nonlinear squares method, which gives correct values of thermodynamic parameters based on the data in a wide range of temperature. The results are discussed in relation to the previous studies on the unfolding by guanidine hydrochloride or by acid. The thermally unfolded state, a partially unfolded species, is shown to be thermodynamically similar to but not identical with the acid state. The folding pathway deduced from the kinetic results is essentially consistent with the folding model of alpha-lactalbumin proposed previously. Large decreases in entropy and in heat capacity during the reversed activation suggest the packing of the folded segments by hydrophobic interactions, while the forward activation shows a marked temperature dependence, probably caused by the disruption of specific long-range interactions.

Continuous processing has been applied to human plasma fractionation by the cold ethanol process. On-line pH control of +/- 0.05 pH units, flow control of +/- 1%, and temperature control of +/- 0.5 degree C have been achieved. Optimization of precipitation pHs has been carried out for purifying plasma protein fractions and albumin. During precipitation, the irreversible nature of the pH overshoots has been demonstrated. Compared to the batch processing mode, the continuous scheme produces an increased yield between 6 to 11%.

As shown in a previous paper, threshold concentrations of lower and intermediate fatty acids inhibit the uptake of inorganic phosphate, growth, and cell division in yeast cells. This demonstrates that, apart from these effects, the acids cause an increase in the respiration quotient (RQ), inhibition of CO2 fixation, production of ethanol at the expense of anabolic processes, and inhibition of active amino acid transport in the yeast Candida utilis. On the other hand, the threshold concentrations have no effect on intracellular pH. The inhibition of the inorganic phosphate uptake cannot be the sole primary mode of action of fatty acids since the omission of inorganic phosphate in the incubation medium brings about an inhibition of anabolic processes that is lower than that brought about by fatty acids since the omission of inorganic phosphate in the incubation medium brings about an inhibition of anabolic processes that is lower than that brought by fatty acids at concentrations still premitting some phosphate uptake. Although 2,4-dinitrophenol and caproic acid at low concentrations cause an analogous decrease in biomass yield, their combination does not bring about any marked increase in the effect. Considering the physicochemical properties of fatty acids and their preferential action on energy-requiring processes, one of the key sites of action can be assumed to be the mitochondrial membrane. Fatty acids might inhibit the transport of anions, especially phosphate, across the membrane, and disturb the membrane potential by affecting the transport protons. The physiocochemical properties of fatty acids may also give rise to their binding to other intracellular membranes and to a subsequent interference with the function of the corresponding organelles.

Semiallogeneic chimeras were produced by injecting 3 X 10(7) spleen cells of mice CBA (H--2k, Mlsd) to lethally irradiated mice (CBA X C57BL/6)F1. Two days later recipients were given cyclophosphamide (CP), 2 mg per mouse, to prevent death of graft versus host reaction (GVHR). For 1.5--2 months after the creation of chimerism in 23 of 26 mice under study all cells producing antibodies to SRBC were represented by donor cells of H-2 phenotype; 3 mice were partial chimeras. Spontaneous blast transformation in the cultures of chimera spleen did not exceed the control level, and in the mixed lymphocyte culture chimera cells failed to proliferate on addition of irradiated lymphocytes (CBA X C57BL/6) F1. At the same time chimera gave intensive blast transformation to the irradiated lymphocytes of the third line of mice DBA/2 (H--2d, Mlsa). Among the chimera spleen cells no killers capable of destroying target cells of donor or recipient origin were revealed. Similar results were obtained in vivo: chimera cells gave no positive local GVHR after administration to mice (CBA X C57BL/6) F1. Prolonged chimerism was accompanied by a reactivity of donor T-lymphocytes to the recipient transplantation antigens. A blocking factor was revealed in the blood serum of chimeras. The substitution of donor lymphocytes for the recipient cells begins after 3 to 5 months. At the same period donor T-cell population reconstitutes partially the responsiveness to the recipient antigens and the blocking factor disappears from chimeras blood.

1 The effects of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists on contractile responses to noradrenaline and methoxamine were examined in isolated saphenous vein strips of the dog. 2 Phentolamine, labetalol and thymoxamine antagonized responses to methoxamine to a greater extent than responses to noradrenaline. 3 Cocaine (3.0 x 10(-5) mol/l) increased the potency of noradrenaline by about eight fold, but had little or no effect on the potency of methoxamine. 4 In the presence of cocaine (3.0 x 10(-5) mol/l) the potency of the antagonists against noradrenaline was increased such that the pA2 values were then similar to those obtained against methoxamine. 5 It is concluded that the lower potency of phentolamine, labetalol and thymoxamine as antagonists of noradrenaline than of methoxamine is due to the presence of an avid saturable uptake1 process in the saphenous vein.

1 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) contracted isolated saphenous vein strips of the dog, producing a biphasic concentration-effect curve. The first phase occurred with low concentrations of 5-HT (1.0 X 10(-8) TO 5.0 X 10(-6) mol/l) with a plateau between 1.0 x 10(-6) mol/l and 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l. The second phase occurred with high concentrations of 5-HT (greater than 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l). 2 The alpha-adrenoceptor antabonists, phentolamine (5.0 x 10(-8) to 5.0 x 10(-7) mol/l), labetalol (1.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l) and thymoxamine (1.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l), antagonized responses to high concentrations of 5-HT but responses to low concentrations of 5-HT were not antagonized. 3 The effects of high concentrations of 5-HT were antagonized by cocaine (1.0 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l) and were not evident in veins removed from dogs pretreated with syrosingopine. 5-HT receptors and that high concentrations of 5-HT also act indirectly on alpha-adrenoceptors by displacing noradrenaline from neuronal stores.

1 The competitive alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent, piperoxan, in concentrations up to 2 x 10(-4) M, produced large dose-dependent increases in transmitter overflow from the isolated blood perfused spleen of the cat following nerve stimulation at 10 hertz. 2 At concentrations greater than 2 x 10(-4) M, piperoxan produced a rise in perfusion pressure, a contraction of the splenic capsule, and a marked dose-dependent decrease in transmitter overflow. 3 Phenoxybenzamine (10(-4) M) and desmethylimipramine (3 x 10(-5) M) produced further increases in transmitter overflow when added after piperoxan. 4 Piperoxan (5.8 to 6.6 x 10(-6) M) had no effect on the recovery of 3H in the venous blood following the close arterial infusion or injection of (3H)-(--)-noradrenaline, indicating that the drug does not inhibit uptake of the amine. 5 Piperoxan produced dose-dependent inhibition of responses of the splenic vasculature to close arterial injection of 1 microgram of (--)-noradrenaline but was much less effective at inhibiting responses to nerve stimulation. At 2 x 10(-6) M piperoxan produced a considerable reduction of the response to injected noradrenaline but potentiated the response to nerve stimulation. 6 In isolated strips of cat splenic capsule, piperoxan produced a shift to the right of the dose-response curve to noradrenaline with no change of the maximum response. There was no evidence of a postsynaptic sensitizing effect of the type observed in the rat vas deferens.

Sequential changes in plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone and noradrenaline were assessed in eight patients with severe hypertension after minoxidil had been added to their treatment. Doses of 2.5--27.5 (mean 12.5) mg/day reduced the mean blood pressure from 166/113 +/-6/2 mm Hg to 124/88+/-4/2 mm Hg in one week. Plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone and noradrenaline increased twofold to threefold initially but returned to baseline values within two to three weeks and remained unchanged during a mean follow-up of 5.1 months. Beta-blocking drugs were then withdrawn slowly in six patients without adverse effects, though blood pressure and heart rate increased in three patients, who required minimal doses of beta-blockers. Plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone and noradrenaline did not change significantly after beta-blockade had been stopped. We conclude that the need for beta-blockade is greatly reduced with long-term minoxidil treatment and that it may be unnecessary in some patients.

Atenolol was compared with five other beta-blockers and a thiazide diuretic in a randomised cross-over trial of once-daily treatment of essential hypertension. Atenolol was significantly better at reducing resting and exercise blood pressures at 24 hours than any of the other drugs and had a low incidence of side effects. Both timolol and acebutolol had a significant hypotensive effect at 24 hours and a low incidence of side effects, suggesting that further increases in dosage might be effective and well tolerated. Labetalol proved ineffective when given once daily, and the high incidence of side effects, equalled only by pindolol, would probably prohibit further increases in dosage. Bendrofluazide was equal or superior to all the beta-blockers except atenolol at reducing resting blood pressure, and its cheapness still makes it an agent of first choice in mild or moderate essential hypertension.

The rat olfactory bulb was studied with the Falck-Hillarp formaldehyde fluorescence technique, including recent modifications, autoradiography and electron microscopic cytochemistry (permanganate fixation). Some periglomerular cells and few superficial tufted cells take up and accumulate catecholamines and precursors. They probably represent dopamine cells. In the glomeruli, probable 5-hydroxy-tryptamine nerve terminals could be identified. In the granular and external plexiform layers, noradrenaline axon terminals were present. At the ultrastructural level, monoamine boutons were in synaptic contact with dendritic spines of granule cells and in the glomeruli, probable 5-hydroxytryptamine boutons formed synapses with periglomerular cell dendrites. Therefore, monoamine afferents to the bulb may exert their influence via interneurons.

Kainic acid (3 nmoles bilaterally) was injected into the dorsal striatum of the rat producing virtually complete destruction of cell bodies in this structure but without directly affecting the dopamine terminals ascending from the substantia nigra and terminating in the striatum. Other fibres of passage, such as the internal capsule, were also spared. The locomotor and stereotypy responses to doses of amphetamine, a dopamine releasing agent, were found to be consistently enhanced after this lesion. The stereotypy and locomotor activity in response to the direct receptor agonist, apomorphine, however were not consistently affected. The results are interpreted in terms of a functional dichotomy between dorsal and ventral striatum and in terms of previously demonstrated electrophysiological alterations in the striatonigral feedback loop after kainic acid injection. Similarities are noted with the effects of these two stimulant drugs in human patients with Huntington's disease, thus strengthening the kainic acid animal model of this disease, first proposed on biochemical grounds.

The chemical isolation of 2,3-diketone fraction from hydrolysates of various mammalian tissues has been accomplished by the use of a modified Girard T procedure. This fraction, which constitutes a new lipid class, has been resolved by gas chromatography into a number of homologous 2,4-diketones, ranging in chain length from C13 to C25. After separation by preparative gas chromatography, the following compounds have been unequivocally identified: 2,4-heptadecanedione, 2,4-nonadecanedione, 2,4-heneicosanedione, 2,4-docosanedione, and delta12-2,4-heneicosenedione. The 2,4-diketones appear to exist in tissues in the free state or in labile combination. They are present also in human urine.

A kinetic study of the reaction of two turnip peroxidases (P1 and P7) with hydrogen peroxide to form the primary oxidized compound (compound I) has been carried out over the pH range from 2.4 to 10.8. In the neutral and acidic pH regions, the rates depend linearly on hydrogen peroxide concentration whereas at alkaline pH values the rates display saturation kinetics. A compound is made with the cyanide binding reaction to peroxidases since the two reactions are influenced in the same manner by ionization of groups on the native enzymes. Two different ionization processes of peroxidase P1 with pKa values of 3.9 and 10 are required to explain the rate pH profile for the reaction with H2O2. Protonation of the former group and ionization of the latter causes a decrease in the rate of reaction of the enzyme with H2O2. In the case of peroxidase P7 a minimum model involves three ionizable groups with pKa values of 2.5, 4 and 9. Protonation of the former two groups and ionization of the latter lowers the reaction rate. In the pH-independent region, the rate of formation of compound I was measured as a function of temperature. From the Arhenius plots the activation energy for the reaction was calculated to be 2.9 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol for P1 and 5.4 +/- 0.3 kcal/mol for P7. However, the rates are independent of viscosity in glycerol-water mixtures up to 30% glycerol.

The isolated nuclei of rat pancreas contain an enzyme system that will incorporate 3H-labeled NAD into an acid-insoluble product, which is shown to be poly(ADP-ribose). The enzyme has an optimum pH of 7.8 and the optimum temperature is between 20 and 30 degrees C. Optimum Mg2+ concentration is 8 mM and dithiothreitol also stimulates the enzyme at a concentration of 8 mM. Under standard conditions, the Km value for the reaction is 0.25 mM and an inhibition by the substrate is observed at high substrate concentrations. It has also been found that only one basic nuclear protein, that is, histone H1, is modified by the synthetase. An average chain length of 5.0 is found in the nuclei and of 4.5 on histone H1. Radioautographic studies show that poly(ADP-ribose) is closely associated with chromatin.

The effects of acid--base alterations produced by changing bicarbonate (metabolic type), carbon dioxide tension (respiratory type), or both bicarbonate and carbon dioxide tension (compensated type) on skeletal muscle twitch tension, intracellular pH, and intracellular potassium were studied in vitro. Hemidiaphragm muscles from normal rats and rats fed a potassium-deficient diet were used. Decreasing the extracellular pH by decreasing bicarbonate or increasing CO2 in the bathing fluid produced a decrease in intracellular pH, intracellular K+, and muscle twitch tension. However, at a constant extracellular pH, an increase in CO2 (compensated by an increase in bicarbonate) produced an increase in intracellular K+ and twitch tension in spite of a decrease in intracellular pH. The effect on twitch tension of the hemidiaphragms showed a rapid onset, was reversible, persisted until the buffer composition was changed, and was independent of synaptic transmission. It is concluded that the twitch tension of the skeletal muscle decrease with a decrease in intracellular K+. The muscle tension also decreases with an increase in the ratio of intracellular and extracellular H+ concentration. However, there is no consistent relationship between muscle tension and extracellular or intracellular pH. The muscle tension of the diaphragms taken from K+-deficient rats is more sensitive to variations in CO2, PH, and bicarbonate concentration of the medium than that of the control rat diaphragms.

The convoluted tubular cells of the male mouse submandibular gland contain many serous-like granules in their apical cytoplasm. The autonomic regulation of the secretory process of the contents of these granules was studied by the following two methods: (1) immunochemical method using an antiserum specific to the granular components; and (2) histometric observations using light and electron microscopes. The results obtained by these two methods were well in agreement. When male mice were administered either phenylephrine or norepinephrine, the amount of granules in the glands significantly decreased. These two adrenergic stimulators were very effective, whereas synephrine was less effective. When mice were injected with a beta-adrenergic agent(isoproterenol) or a parasympathomimetic agent (pilocarpine), the amount of granules in the glands did not change. The alpha-adrenergic blockers phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine almost completely neutralized the effect of alpha-adrenergic agents on the glands, whereas another alpha-blocker (ergotamine) was less effective. These facts suggest that the secretion of the granular components is mediated by way of alpha-adrenergic receptor sites in the glands.

The prognosis for patients with AML is improving, but mortality due to bleeding and infection remains significant. HLA compatibility has been the cornerstone of matching for prophylactic platelet transfusion; while HLA matched platelets are often of benefit, we have observed that HLA matching does not reliably predict transfusion responses. The platelet migration inhibition assay is, however, consistently predictive. The matching problem may be circumvented by the use of frozen autologous platelets, which circulate and function hemostatically. In the granulocytopenic patient with de novo fever (frequently due to bacterial sepsis), the immediate empiric use of broad spectrum antibiotics is mandatory. If the marrow begins to recover from chemotherapy shortly after the onset of infection, such that the peripheral granulocyte count will approach normal within 10 days, the likelihood of survival from an episode of septicemia after antibiosis now approaches 80%. If the marrow does not recover shortly, however, the likelihood of survival with antibiosis alone is poor. In this setting, survival is improved if patients are given granulocyte transfusions in addition to antibiotics. Patients who receive chemotherapy in a laminar air-flow room (LAFR) experience fewer severe infections than do patients in a conventional ward. However, most patients who are unresponsive to initial chemotherapy remain so in spite of protection from infection. Thus, the available results do not suggest that the LAFR is likely to improve appreciably the rate or duration of remission. Using malignant lymphoma as a model, we have found that cryopreserved autologous marrow infusions can hasten hematopoietic recovery in man after high-dose chemotherapy, and earlier reconstitution may be of clinical benefit to the patient; techniques are at hand that might permit the application of this concept to AML.

Marrow transplantation enables the physician to ignore the complications of marrow toxicity which limit the chemotherapy of leukemia and makes it possible to explore new drugs and regimens. The results of marrow transplantation for 154 cases of end-stage acute leukemia carried out by the Seattle Marrow Transplant Team are summarized. Even with the use of an HLA matched sibling as a donor, allogeneic marrow transplantation is followed by graft-versus-host disease in about 2/3 of the patients which is of life-threatening severity in approximately 20%. An actuarial plot of the recurrence rate of leukemia following transplantation shows that about 2/3 of the recipients of either allogeneic or syngeneic (identical twin) marrow will relapse within 2 years. However, about 1/3 will not relapse and recurrence of leukemia has not been observed after 2 years. A Kaplan-Meier plot of the survival of 29 syngeneic marrow recipients and 110 recipients of allogeneic marrow shows an almost flat survival curve in the period f om 2 to 7 years after transplantation. The leukemia free survival of these patients on no maintenance chemotherapy constitutes an operational definition of cure in these patients.

Cysteine had been reported to increase survival time in thymoma-bearing mice and the interpretation suggested was that this was due to inhibition of a collagenase activity associated with some tumor cells by a chelating action of cysteine. In the present work it was shown that cysteine was a particularly potent inhibitor of amino acid transport into S37 ascites tumor cells, raising another possible interpretation of the earlier data. Sarcomas have previously been reported to lack collagenase activity; a survival study using S37 cells was therefore undertaken in an attempt to distinguish between possible interpretations of the earlier data involving thymomas. A null result was obtained with either cysteine or EDTA, reinforcing the earlier interpretation that survival enhancement with thymoma-bearing mice was due to an effect on collagenase. Other sulfhydryl analogs were found to inhibit transport also, and the effect was more pronounced with system L than system A. The reason for cysteine's particularly potent action on amino acid transport may be associated either with chelation of a metal ion involved in transport, or the involvement of the gamma-glutamyl cycle in the support of amino acid transport.

A 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine has recently been licensed for general use after extensive testing in human subjects. Antibody production was satisfactory in 92% of individuals and a highly significant (76-92%) reduction was found in the rates for pneumococcal pneumonias caused by the capsular types present in the vaccine. Children over 2 years of age respond well to the vaccine, but younger children may not respond satisfactorily to some capsular types. In adults, the duration of the protective effect is at present unknown, but no substantial booster response was seen after a second dose at 1 year. Such a booster dose, in fact, induced a marked increase in the degree of local reaction at the injection site.

1. HCI, commonly used to preserve urine for steroid analysis, cannot safely be supplied to out of town patients. 2. An equimolar mixture of Na2SO4 and NaHSO4 is a safe alternative which may be used to protect specimens en route to the laboratory. 3. Addition of bisulfate buffer to urine (20 g/l) reduced the pH to 2.0-3.5 (31 specimens; 24 hr urine volumes, 560-3320 ml). 4. Little change in pH was observed when buffered urine (12 specimens) was kept at 30 degrees for 14 days (initial pH 2.62 +/- 0.38 (mean +/- standard deviation); PH after 14 days, 2.59 +/- 0.48). 5. Analysis of the creatinine, 17-oxosteroids, 17-oxogenicsteroids, estrogens, pregnanediol, androsterone + etiocholanolone and estriol in urine samples acidified to pH 2-3 with HCl, and in the same samples acidified with buffer, gave results which were indistinguishable from each other. 6. Almost no change in steroid and creatinine concentrations was observed in samples of buffered urine kept for 10 days at room temperature (20-26 degrees).

We describe a new calcium ion-selective electrode for measurement of the substance concentration of free calcium ion [Ca2+] in the plasma phase of whole blood and in serum at 37 degrees C. A sample volume of 50 microliter suffices to obtain simultaneous values of pH and [Ca2+]. We found the within-series analytical standard deviation for serum to be 0.013 mmol/litre (CV, 1.1%) and day-to-day precision to be 0.022 mmol/litre (CV, 1.7%). The reference interval for [Ca2+] (at pH 7.40) in serum was found to be 1.184 +/- 0.054 mmol/litre (2 SD) from measurements on sera from 121 healthy blood donors. Measurements on capillary blood from 29 healthy volunteers gave a mean (+/- 2 SD) value for [Ca2+] (at pH 7.40) of 1.22 +/- 0.072 mmol/litre.

Measurement of colloid osmotic pressure complements measurements of pulmonary artery wedge pressure for assessing the risks of pulmonary edema and constitutes an increasingly important reference for purposes of guiding selection of colloid or crystalloid fluids in patients with acute cardiac disease. We describe a simple device for its routine clinical measurement. A membrane, selectively impermeable to molecules of relative molecular mass (Mr) greater than 30000, is rigidly mounted between a sample chamber and a reference chamber filled with isotonic saline. A pressure transducer measures the negative pressure developed in the reference chamber and displays it on a digital panel meter. The sensor chamber accommodates samples of 50 to 300 microliter. Equilibration is completed within 2 min. A control solution of human serum albumin (50 g/liter) is measured to confirm the accuracy of calibration of the system, with reproducible readings of 25.9 g/cm2 within one SD (equivalent to 0.4 g/cm2). Technical simplicity of operation and modest costs of disposables have made feasible the routine measurement of colloid osmotic pressure.

We have measured total carbon dioxide in plasma with a new carbon dioxide analyzer, and compared the results with total carbon dioxide data derived from measurements of carbon dioxide tension and pH. The results agree sufficiently well to demonstrate that the new instrument provides a simple, efficient procedure for monitoring the precision and accuracy of pH, carbon dioxide tension, or total carbon dioxide in plasma.

Phosphate-buffered saline was found to inhibit acid beta-glucosidase activity of cultured cells. This effect was attributable to both the pH and the chloride content of the phosphate-buffered saline. Washing the cells in sucrose (0.25M) to remove residual phosphate-buffered saline effectively eliminated this inhibition.

Outpatient prescriptions dispensed to 17,000 individuals in the county of Jämtland, Sweden, have been analyzed with regard to doses and dosage schedules. Two groups of drugs were studied; one group with marked interindividual variability in metabolism (antidepressants, beta receptor blockers, and phenytoin), the other group excreted unchanged in the urine (digoxin, nitrofurantoin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline). A 25-fold-15-fold variability in daily doses was found for amitriptyline and nortiptyline, respectively. Four-fifths of the prescriptions were for doses between 30 and 75 mg, making the mean dose remarkably low-58 and 48 mg, respectively. The variability in doses was higher for the beta receptor blockers propranolol and alprenolol. Daily doses of phenytoin varied between 0.1 and 0.6 gm, 93% of the doses falling between 0.2 and 0.4 gm. Generally, doses of sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin prescribed to children were correctly reduced. In the elderly the doses of these drugs and tetracycline and digoxin were only moderately reduced in discrepancy with the physiologic impairment of kidney function. The clinical significance of these findings has not been evaluated. The effect of drug information programs on dosage intervals prescribed for procainamide, phenytoin, and beta receptor blocking drugs is demonstrated. It is suggested that more emphasis be given to general pharmacokinetic principles in drug information programs.

Ten healthy volunteers ingested single 15-mg doses of clorazepate dipotassium (CZP) with 60 ml of water, or with 60 ml of magnesium aluminum hydroxide (Maalox), on two occasions in a randomized, two-way crossover study. Plasma concentrations of desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) were determined in multiple samples drawn during 48 hr after each dose. Mean kinetic variables for DMDZ in CZP-water and CZP-magnesium aluminum hydroxide treatment conditions, respectively, were: peak measured concentration, 273 and 188 ng/ml (p 0.001); time of peak concentration, 1.8 and 2.8 hr after dose (p less than 0.01); apparent absorption half-life, 14.8 and 30.7 min (p less than 0.02); area under the 48-hr plasma concentration curve, 6,028 and 5,433 ng/ml X hr (p less than 0.02). Self-rated sensations of feedling "spacey," "thinking slowed down," and of generalized sedation, were reported with both treatment conditions, but these subjective effects occurred earlier and were more profound when CZP was taken with water as opposed to magnesium aluminum hydroxide. Thus administration of single doses of CZP with usual doses of a commonly prescribed antacid reduces the rate and extent of appearance in blood of DMDZ (the compound responsible for clinical activity) and attenuates self-rated clinical effects.

1. In seventeen patients with untreated essential hypertension the sodium and water contents of leucocytes were significantly increased, whereas the rate constant for ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux was significantly reduced. 2. These abnormalities were not found in fourteen other patients with well-controlled hypertension. 3. Preliminary observations in accelerated hypertension suggest a different pattern of abnormality in leucocyte sodium metabolism.

1. A clinical study of pyratrione, a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, has been carried out in essential hypertension. 2. Out of thirty-nine patients who received pyratrione, twenty-eight showed a significant decrease in blood pressure.

1. DL-Propranolol, L-propranolol, DL-alprenolol, pindolol (LB46), practolol, ICI 66082, sotalol and oxprenolol all produced prolonged falls in blood pressure and heart rate after intracerebroventricular administration in conscious normotensive cats. 2. Transient initial pressor responses and tachycardias were observed after intracerebroventricular infusions of all the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists used, except ICI 66082. 3. D-Propranolol, D-alphrenolol, procaine and lignocaine all produced initial increases in blood pressure and heart rate but did not subsequently cause any reduction in either blood pressure or heart rate. 4. The time of maximum hypotension and bradycardia after intracerebroventricular infusion of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists coincided with the maximum inhibition of the centrally mediated tachycardia observed after intracerebroventricular isoprenaline.

1. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and mean blood pressure were studied in conscious rabbits infused with beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists. 2. Oxprenolol and DL-propranolol each significantly reduced PRA and blood pressure, but prindolol, which had a strong blood pressure-lowering effect, increased PRA. 3. When prindolol was given to animals in which PRA and blood pressure had been reduced by DL-propranolol, PRA returned to control values but blood pressure remained low. Thus the increase in PRA caused by prindolol is not mediated by hypotension. These findings, together with the observation that compound H35/25 reduced PRA without altering blood pressure, suggest that the effects of the beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs on blood pressure are unrelated to their effects on renin release. 4. Studies with D-propranolol and with blocking agents with either beta-1 or beta-2 specificity indicated that the effects of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade on renin are directly dependent upon their action on beta-adrenergic receptors, probably of the beta-2 type.

Clinical measurements were made of the effects of various drugs on the stimulation threshold of human heart [right ventricle]. Of antiarrhythmic drugs, a marked and prolonged elevation of the stimulation threshold was produced by procainamide, quinidine, and aimaline. Relatively short-lasting elevation was elicited by local anaesthetics [trimecaine, lidocaine]. Beta-blockers were little effective. No detectable effect on the stimulation threshold was produced by phenytoin and digitalis glucosides from the group of antiarrhythmics. The deepest and most prolonged depression of the stimulation threshold was achieved with anabolics [nandrolone phenylpropionate, nandrolone decanoate] and with high doses of prednisone and of 6-methylprednisolone sodium succinate. Hydrocortisone was ineffective. A slight and brief depression was produced by atrophine. The effects of sympathomimetics were complicated: at stimulation with short pulses the threshold was always raised. At stimulation with long pulses the effects were variable, mostly biphasic [occasionally triphasic]: a transitory depression of the stimulation threshold was followed by a marked elevation. The I-t curve's slope altered. In exit block, sympathomimetics are indicated because of their chronotropic effect, not because of their questionable effect on the stimulation threshold. A number of drugs, often administered to stimulated patients, produced no effect on the stimulation threshold: antibiotics, nitrites, purine compounds, opiates, and others.

These results establish the existence of a cytoplasmic glutaminase-gamma-glutamyltransferase enzyme as a distinct entity. Its products are ammonia and activated glutamate. Ammonia liberation is obligatory to the utilization of the amide bond energy in forming gamma-glutamyl-PO4. This activated glutamate can then be utilized in the gamma-glutamyl cycle for the synthesis of gamma-glutamylcysteine. The cytoplasmic glutamine utilizing pathway is closely coupled to gamma-glutamyl cycl activity: loading the cycle stimulates increased renal glutamine uptake into this pathway. Consequently, the pathway, stimulated by elevated ADP levels, appears to function as an auxilary source of gamma-glutamyl moieties for the gamma-glutamyl cycle. Although insignificant compared to the mitochondrial pathway's contribution to ammonia production in metabolic acidosis, it is highly significant from the perspective of the Unitary Hypothesis. The existence of this dual system allows the demonstration of a shift in glutamine utilization from predominant cytoplasmic to overwhelming mitochondrial glutamine utilization in metabolic acidosis corresponding to a rise in the NH3/gln ratio from 1.2 to 1.9 and a quantitative recovery of gln carbon as CO2 and glucose. The fact that this shift in pathways is induced by acidosis (through adrenosteroids) and that it represents a 10 to 20 fold activation of the mitochondrial pathway is completely consistent with a glucocorticoid mediated glutamine permeability increase of the inner mitochondrial membrane.

The H+ ion secretion in the proximal tubule as revealed by the reabsorption of the glycodiazine buffer vanishes when the ambient solutions are sodium-free. The same holds for other Na+-dependent transport processes such as Ca++, phosphate, glucose and amino acid reabsorption. If Na+ transport is blocked by ouabain the latter transport processes are abolished, the secretion of H+ ions, however, remains unchanged suggesting H+ to be not exclusively driven by active Na+ transport. These observations agree with electrical measurements which show an electrogenic component of H+ secretion to exist in rat proximal tubule. In experiments with isolated membrane vesicles an electroneutral Na+/H+-exchange mechanism could be demonstrated in the brush border membrane and an ATP-driven Ca++ pumpt as well as Na+-Ca++ countertransport in the baso-lateral cell membrane. These data suggest that both, the Na+ gradient and ATP, are used to drive H+ ion secretion across the luminal brush border and Ca++ reabsorption across the baso-lateral cell side. The biochemical nature of the various systems and their relative importance for the transepithelial ion movement remain to be elucidated.

alpha-Ketoglutarate (KG) is a potent inhibitor of renal mitochondrial glutamine transport and deamidation at physiological concentrations. The concentration-inhibition relationship observed between KG and mitochondrial glutamine transport and deamidation indicates that changes in renal KG concentration occurring during alterations in acid-base balance would have significant effects on mitochondrial ammonia production in vivo. A rapid-mixing, rapid-filtration method was developed to measure the effects of KG on initial rates of mitochondrial glutamine transport. Transport was linear for only a few seconds and approached steady-state conditions by 30 seconds. KG (0.3 mM) raised the glutamine transport Km approximately two-fold. We propose that KG may play a major regulatory role in the early adaptation of renal ammonia production to acidosis.

The use of neuropharmacological agents in neuroendocrine studies has had a significant impact on our knowledge about the neurotransmitter systems that are involved in the control of prolactin secretion. Selective drugs have played a key role in the identification of the dopaminergic inhibitory and serotonergic stimulatory influences. With the development of additional specific neuropharmacological agents in the future, we can expect to gain a better understanding of the complex neural interrelationships involved in the control of anterior pituitary hormone secretion. In view of what we already know about the neurotransmitters involved in the control of prolactin release, a tentative neuronal configuration can be proposed. The following neuronal network most probably does not include several components that may be shown by future studies to be involved in prolactin control, but it does represent a possible functional network based on what knowledge is at the present time (Fig. 4).

Phosphate loading in acutely thyroparathyroidectomized rats is followed by a decline of phosphate reabsorption. In addition, a mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis and hypocalcemia develop. Normalization of plasma calcium concentration, unlike the reversal of the alkalosis, prevents the fall in phosphate reabsorption.

Brush border (BB) membranes, isolated from human kidney cortex by density gradient centrifugation, revealed a distinct pattern of structural proteins as could be shown by bio- and immunochemical studies. Marker enzymes such as gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGTP) and alanine-aminopeptidase (AAP) were characterized as extrinsic; alkaline phosphatase (AP) was characterized as an integral constituent of the BB membrane. The surface of the BB membranes exhibited numerous 5 nm particles bound through a linear component to the peripheral BB matrix (negative staining). Increase of AAP and GGTP (30%) activity in the supernatant after proteolytic treatment of BB fragments paralleled selective release of these constituents from the membranes. The surface components were found to be part of BB concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin receptor sites. Labelled antisera directed against surface glycoprotein fractions gave a specific immuno fluorescence staining of only the luminal plasma-membrane from the proximal tubule epithelia.

CoA transfer from acetoacetyl-CoA to maleate catalyzed by purified CoA transferase was studied. The thioester product of the reaction undergoes further chemical transformations and the final product appeared to be stable CoA derivative showing neither free SH group nor hydrolyzable thio-acyl bond. Similar product was obtained as the result of the reaction of addition of CoA to the double bond of maleic anhydride. This was confirmed by DEAE-chromatography. The decrease of free CoA and acid soluble acyl-CoA in kidney mitochondria respiring in the presence of maleate or in the kidney of maleate-treated rats occured without appreciable changes in acid insoluble acyl-CoA derivatives. As the result substantial loss of total content of CoA was found. The data indicate that maleate binds and removes CoA in the form of stable and metabolically inert compound.

A case of a severe systemic anaphylactoid reaction is reported in a patient treated with dextran 60 to prevent venous thrombosis. Significant improvement of clinical symptoms occurred after the usual treatment of such incidents with corticosteroids, histamine H1 receptor antagonists, and plasma substitutes was supplemented with a histamine H2 receptor antagonist. We would therefore like to recommend that for such cases a histamine H2 receptor antagonist should be given in addition to the usual medication with corticosteroids and histamine H1 receptor antagonists. However, the value of complete histamine antagonism in these rather rare occurrences, can only be determined after furtherexperience has been gained.

Rats given a single ip injection of p-xylene suffered 65% loss of pulmonary microsomal p-xylene hydroxylase activity. The activity was protected by pretreating the rats with phenobarbital, which increased hepatic p-xylene hydroxylase and cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, but had no effect on alcohol dehydrogenase activity in hepatic cytosol. Pretreatment of rats with pyrazole caused a 60% inhibition of liver alcohol dehydrogenase but had no effect on liver aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. This treatment partially protected the pulmonary microsomal p-xylene hydroxylase from inactivation by p-xylene. Experiments in vitro showed that inactivation of cytochrome P-450 by p-xylene required the metabolic conversion of p-xylene to p-tolualdehyde. The reactive intermediate (p-tolualdehyde) required the presence of NADPH to carry out the inactivation. Inasmuch as lung tissues cannot form p-tolualdehyde (because of the low activity of p-methylbenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase), it is assumed that the inactivation of lung enzymes in vivo following exposure to p-xylene was due to the aldehyde intermediate which is formed in the liver and transported to the lung.

Hydroxylation of cyclohexene at the allylic position has been shown to occur in hepatic microsomes and 9000 g supernatant fractions of rats and rabbits. The formation of the product, 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, requires the presence of a NADPH-generating system, is inhibited by CO, metyrapone, and SKF 525-A, and is induced by pretreatment with phenobarbital. A small amount of 2-cyclohexen-1-one is also formed in preparations from phenobarbital-pretreated rats. No 2-cyclohexen-1-ol could be detected in the beta-glucuronidase-hydrolyzed urine of rats given cyclohexene orally; however, these rats excreted a small quantity of 2-cyclohexen-1-one.

Phenylacetone, phenyl-2-butanone, and 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-butanone were incubated with rabbit liver 9000g supernatant fraction for 30 and 60 min to yield primarily the alcohols, plus small amounts of 1,2-glycols and ketols (2-one-1-ols). Phenylacetone incubations produced small amounts of benzoic acid, which was confirmed as a true metabolite by incubation of 2H5 (phenyl-labeled) phenylacetone and corresponding recovery of phenyl-labeled benzoic acid. No benzoic acid was detectable from incubations of phenyl-2-butanone and 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-butanone. 3-Methyl-1-phenyl-2-butanone yielded eight metabolites in addition to the corresponding alcohol, and structures are proposed for some of these metabolic products.

The reductive metabolism of nitrofurantoin under anaerobic conditions was characterized in various tissues from control, germ-free, and germ-free acclimatized rats. Nitrofurantoin metabolism was highest in homogenates of cecum and colon contents of germ-free acclimatized and control rats, but was absent from those of germ-free animals. Appreciable levels of activity were also present in homogenates of liver and of small intestine walls with lesser rates of metabolism observed in kidney homogenates. The major metabolite of nitrofurantoin, which was isolated and purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography, was identified as 1-[[(3-cyano-1-oxopropyl)-methylene]amino]-2,4-imidazolidinedione. A second, minor metabolite with high-pressure liquid chromatography and ultraviolet absorption characteristics similar to those of 1-[[(5-amino-2-furanyl)methylene]amino]-2,4-imidazolidinedione (aminofurantoin) was detected in cecum and colon contents.

Glucuronides of two metabolites of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, 11-hydroxy-delta9-THC and 5'-hydroxy-delta9-THC, have been synthesized and characterized. Two isomeric monoglucuronides were isolated from the incubation of each metabolite with UDP-glucuronyltransferase immobilized on beaded Sepharose. The structures of these conjugates were assigned primarily on the basis of combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Walker 256 rat carcinosarcoma cells growing as solid subcutaneous or intramuscular tumors depressed hepatic microsomal mixed-function oxygenase activity to less than 20% of control activity, but the same tumor cells growing as free ascites cells in the peritoneal cavity did not. Necrosis of the core area of solid tumors was observed. Tumor cells may release a substance that depresses hepatic microsomal mixed-function oxygenase activity only upon their death.

Determination of the binding affinities of 125I-labeled cholecystographic agents to human serum albumin by ultrafiltration techniques is complicated by the appearance of radiochemical impurities resulting from radiolysis of the parent compound. With labeled compounds purified daily by two extractions through chloroform, iophenoxic acid has an extremely high binding affinity. The dissociation constant (K) is 0.013 micronM for iophenoxate, compared to 0.15 micronM for iopanoate, its close analogue. However, at the weaker sites, iophenoxic acid is less strongly bound than iopanoate. The exceptionally high affinity of iophenoxate for a single site of serum albumin appears to underlie its unusual persistence in plasma. Binding in vivo is reversible and not covalent in nature. The choleretic compounds cinchophen and taurocholate have differential effects on the biliary excretion of iophenoxate and iopanoate. This cannot be attributed to selective inhibition of binding to plasma protein.

In the rat, the major water-soluble biliary metabolite of digotoxin is digitoxigenin monodigitoxoside glucuronide (mono-gluc). Despite its preponderance in the bile, only small amounts of mono-gluc are found in the feces. The compound may be absorbed from the intestine as the glucuronide conjugate, or it may be hydrolyzed to the parent compound, digitoxigenin monodigitoxoside (mono); the parent compound might then be absorbed from the intestine. The purposes of this study were to determine the ability of closed duodenal and cecal strips in vivo to absorb the conjugate and the parent compound, to hydrolyze the glucuronide, and to conjugate the parent mono. Absorption of mono was found to be more rapid than mono-gluc in both intestinal locations. Absorption of mono in the cecal strip was slower than in the duodenal strip. Considerable hydrolysis of mono-gluc occurred in the cecal strip; in the duodenal strip, the net process was conjugated of the parent mono. Thus, the disappearance of mono-gluc between its appearance in the bile and excretion in the feces is explained mainly by hydrolysis in the lower intestinal tract. Paradoxically, absorption of the hydrolysis product, mono, proceeds more slowly in the lower intestine, where it is hydrolyzed, than in the duodenum, where hydrolysis does not occur.

The metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) was studied in the isolated perfused rabbit lung and in rabbit pulmonary microsomes. Pretreatment of rabbits with 3-methylcholanthrene did not increase the metabolism of BP by microsomal preparations, and the pretreatment did not induce cytochrome P-448 in pulmonary microsomes. In the isolated perfused lung, BP was metabolized at a rate of about 6 nmol/min/g of lung. The intermediate arene oxides formed from BP in the isolated perfused lung were metabolized nonoxidatively by epoxide hydrase and glutathione S-transferases. The rates of the latter reactions were at least an order of magnitude less than the overall rate of metabolism. Pretreatment of the animals with 3-methylcholanthrene increased only the apparent rate of the epoxide hydrase reaction. In the isolated perfused lung, BP and some of its less polar metabolites (i.e., quinones and phenolic derivatives) were preferentially partitioned into lung tissue, precluding accurate measurement of metabolic rates by analysis of the perfusion medium alone. Covalent binding of BP-derived radioactivity to lung tissue occurred, but relatively high variability in this parameter in lungs from 3-methylcholanthrene-pretreated animals did not allow measurement of a significant difference from control lungs.

The plasma-protein binding of phenytoin in rats was impaired for more than 14 days after a single injection of sodium oleate compared to that observed in saline-treated controls. A maximum free (unbound) phenytoin fraction value of about 0.30 was found between 30 and 120 min after oleate administration. The free fraction decreased to about 0.20 after 14 days. The free fraction of phenytoin in control rats was essentially constant over this period and averaged about 0.17. The impaired plasma-protein binding of phenytoin was unaffected by prolonged dialysis but was effectively reversed by charcoal treatment of the plasma. Comparison of the in vivo and in vitro effects of sodium oleate on phenytoin binding in plasma indicates that the reduction in binding is unrelated to the in vivo oleate concentration in plasma at the time of the binding determination. For example, 5 min after a bolus injection of oleate, the plasma free fraction of phenytoin was about 0.33. A comparable concentration of oleate in control plasma resulted in a free phenytoin fraction of only 0.21.

The binding of two cholecystographic agents, iophenoxate and iopanoate, to human serum albumin was studied with 11 putative competitors; the results were qualitatively consistent with competitive binding to common sites. A more precise analysis of competition was achieved with four pairs of compounds for which the free and bound concentration of each was determined. The results were analyzed by a computer program and the dissociation constants calculated for both binder and competitor at specified sites on albumin. With numbering based on the rank order of dissociation constants for iophenoxate, the highest binding of the four compounds occurs at different sites: iophenoxate at site I; iopanoate at site II, sulfobromophthalein at site III; and bromphenol blue at site II. For a given compound, there is close agreement in the calculated affinities at different sites regardless of the competitor.

The fate of intravenously administered [7-3H]isoproterenol was investigated in cats. Ten minutes after injection the concentration of 3H was highest in the heart, lungs, adrenals, and kidneys, but after 5 hr most of the radioactivity was found in the liver. The concentration of the unchanged drug in the serum declined in a biphasic manner with half-lives of 2.1--2.5 min for the first phase, and 58--77 min for the second phase. The drug was rapidly metabolized to 3-O-methylisoproterenol (MISP) and then conjugated. In 5 hr 44--55% of the administered 3H was excreted in the urine, 2--2.5% as unchanged drug, 21--41% as MISP, and 12--22% as conjugated MISP. Conjugated MISP was also found in the bile. The results indicate that the rate of formation of MISP in cats is much faster than its rate of conjugation and excretion.

Following intragastric doses of 14C-oxaprozin to beagle dogs and rhesus monkeys, oxaprozin was rapidly absorbed and was essentially the only drug-related substance in the plasma for at least 24 hr. Recovery of radioactivity in the excreta was 87% in both species, with the fecal route accounting for almost all of the excretion by the dog, and the urinary route predominating in the monkey. The drug was slowly eliminated by both species. The concentrations in tissues of monkeys were generally less than those in plasma, and their decline with time paralleled that in plasma. High concentrations of 14C were found in the bile and urine. Qualitative and quantitative metabolite patterns of both fluids were similar. About 90% of the 14C in both bile and urine was recovered as identified compounds in the free, ester conjugate, and ether conjugate fractions. The ester conjugate fraction, mainly consisting of oxaprozin glucuronide, was quantitatively the most important in both fluids. Two phenolic metabolites were characterized by mass spectrometry and co-chromatography. They were present in free form and as ester and ether glucuronides.

Two isomeric methoxyhydroxy metabolites of propranolol have been identified in man during chronic antihypertensive propranolol therapy. The identification was based on the mass-spectral fragmentation pattern of their trifluoroacetylated derivatives. Both isomers were detected in urine as well as in plasma, mainly as glucuronic acid and/or sulfate conjugates. The amounts of these metabolites excreted in urine were linearly related (r = 0.84) to the oral propranolol dose, 10--320 mg per day. Plasma concentrations at the 320-mg daily dose ranged from 20 to 112 ng/ml. Similar isomeric methoxyhydroxy metabolites of propranolol containing a glycol or a lactic acid side-chain were also identified.

Systolic blood pressure, heart rate and concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine as well as plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) were measured in 22 subjects in recumbency and on standing up. Six subjects each had previously been given intravenously dihydroergotamine (0.5 mg) or etilefrine (0.25 mg/min) or a placebo. It was demonstrated that orthostasis leads to an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal system. After administration of dihydroergotamine there was a diminished reaction of the sympathetic nervous system with an increase of venous tone which counteracted the decrease in cardiac output. Etilefrine, on the other hand, inhibited the sympatho-adrenal reaction on orthostasis and decreased the liberation of adrenaline. It acts directly via stimulation of alpha-and beta-receptors and is thus predominantly indicated if there is insufficient response of the baroreceptor reflex at its efferent limb.

Glucuronide metabolites of carbamazepine (5 H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide) were identified in human urine following chromatography on XAD-2 resin, permethylation, and combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry with an SE-30 capillary column. Eight glucuronide metabolites, previously unidentified in man, were characterized as their permethylated derivatives. These included carbamazepine N-glucuronide (M+. 482), three isomers of dihydroxycarbamazepine O-glucuronide (M+. 542), three isomers of hydroxymethoxycarbamazepine O-glucuronide (M+. 542), and one isomer of hydroxycarbamazepine O-glucuronide (M+. 512). Other glucuronide metabolites, previously identified following enzymatic hydrolysis, were characterized as the unhydrolyzed, permethylated glucuronides, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-di--hydroxy carbamazepine O-glucuronide (M+. 544), and three isomers of monohydroxycarbamazepine O-glucuronide (M+. 512).

A therapeutic trial has been carried out on 50 patients, most of them being hospitalized, in order to compare the characteristics of a new benzamide, Sultopride, to those of a butyrophenone, Fluanisone, for the treatment of important and chronic agitation states. Clinically, they were essentially psychotic states, with dissociation. From this trial it appeared that sultopride is superior to fluanizone with regard to their sedative effects and that it has specific characteristics: a very powerful antipsychotic action, an increasing efficiency over time, as well as an improvement of incoercible agitation in children. Thus, the present trial has checked out the well-known sedative action of Fluanisone, and has revealed a new major antipsychotic drug, Sultopride, the superiority of which lies on a much wider therapeutic field.

The author reports five cases of relatively young women, in good general health, except that one of them had alcoholic liver disease, who presented a confusional state on taking neuroleptics: a widely used butyrophenone, prescribed for a psychotic condition. Owing to the low incidence of this side effect, these clinical cases were worth reporting. Furthermore, a trial of interpretation led us to believe that these reductions in consciousness were due to resistance to treatment.

Clinical trials with propranolol were performed in 44 carefully selected psychiatric patients. Propranolol was administered in 8 equal doses over 24 hours and increased at a daily rate of 400 mg. Treatment was monitored by patient's reactions and by periodic examination of pulse rate and blood pressure. Results showed marked to moderate improvement, often within 24 to 48 hours, in two-thirds of the patients treated. Concurrent with stabilization of heart rate and blood pressure at about 60/min and 90/60 mm Hg respectively, improvement was noted in anxiety, psychomotor hyperactivity, thought process disturbance, hallucinations, and disturbances in affect. Our studies and those of other investigators indicate that propranolol and oxprenolol, and possibly other beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, may have a beneficial influence on psychotic syndromes. Further well-controlled clinical trials seem warranted. Indications for use, dosages, and combinations with other drugs, mainly phenothiazines, must be delineated. Laboratory investigations may add considerably in these respects ans may lead to safe treatment regimes with minimal side effects.

The metabolism of hydrocodone was studied in man, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and dog. Routes of metabolism included O-demethylation, N-dealkylation, and 6-keto-reduction to the corresponding 6-alpha- and 6-beta-hydroxy metabolites, where each metabolic pathway produces an active metabolite. Mean total recovery of drug and metabolites as percentage of administered dose ranged from a low of 10.6% for the rabbit to a high of 46.8% for the guinea pig; man was intermediate at 25.7%. For man, approximately 70% of the total drug recovered was excreted in the first 24 hr, and the remainder by 72 hr. Considerable species differences were observed in the patterns of metabolism of hydrocodone. Also, stereoselectivity of 6-keto reduction to the beta-form was observed for all species in the reduction of hydrocodone and hydromorphone with the exception of the reduction of hydrocodone by man.

The mechanism of the inactivation of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from Candida utilis with two coenzyme analogues can be differentiated on the basis of kinetic studies and of the properties of the inactivated enzyme. 3-Chloroacetylpyridine--adenine dinucleotide phosphate is clearly an affinity label and 3-choloroacetylpyridine--adenine dinucleotide a second-order reagent. For 3-chloroacetylpyridine--adenine dinucleotide phosphate, there is a loss of one thiol per subunit at complete inactivation whereas for 3-chloroacetylpyridine--adenine dinucleotide 2.7 thiol groups are lost. The fluorescence of the protein is quenched after alkylation by 3-chloroacetylpyridine--adenine dinucleotide phosphate and there is no quenching after the inactivation with 3-chloroacetylpyridine--adenine dinucleotide.

The overall reaction catalyzed by the phosphotransferase arginine kinase was studied at normal and subzero temperatures. Ethylene glycol was used as the antifreeze and its effects on the Km values of substances, kcat and pH profiles were investigated in detail. a) The Km values for the substrate (2 mM for ATP and 0.6 mM for arginine) were little affected by the solvent composition or temperature of the reaction mixture. b) At concentration of ethylene glycol higher than 40% there was a sharp drop of enzyme activity. c) Ethylene glycol induces a large shift in the enzymic pK D) At -5 degrees C in 40% of solvent there was a break in the Arrhenius plot suggesting a change of the rate-limiting step. The relevance of these results to the reaction pathway of arginine kinase is discussed. In addition, controlled perturbations induced by cosolvent and temperature appear as useful tools for further kinetic investigations.

The enzymes mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase, mannitol-1-phosphatase, mannitol dehydrogenase and hexokinase participate in an enzymatic cycle in the fungus Alternaria alternata. One turn of the cycle gives the net result: NADH + NADP+ + ATP leads to NAD+ + NADPH + ADP + Pi. The cycle alone can meet the total need of NADPH formation for fat synthesis in the organism. A polyketide producing strain of A. alternata shows a lower mannitol oxidation as well as a lower fat synthesis than a nonproducing mutant, supporting the hypothesis that polyketide formation is favoured at limiting NADPH production. It is further suggested that the mannitol cycle is regulating the glycolytic flux by substrate withdrawal from phosphofructokinase.

Steroid-receptor complexes formed in concentrated cytosol at low temperature, low ionic strength and neutral pH are unable to bind to nuclei. Various procedures are known to promote their 'activation'. In the present work it is shown that an increase in temperature only enhances the rate of the reaction whereas no change in the equilibrium between activated and non-activated complexes is observed. On the contrary an increase in ionic strength or pH, as well as a removal of a low-molecular-weight inhibitor, not only accelerate the reaction but also increase the concentration of activated complexes at equilibrium. Using two steroids differing 3-fold in their affinity for the receptor, no difference was seen in the effect of the bound steroid on receptor activation. When combining various activation procedures it was observed that they acted independently of each other and additively. In all cases they retained their property of either modifying only the rate of the reaction or both its rate and equilibrium. Using changes in pH, it was also possible to induce shifts in the equilibrium between activated and non-activated complexes. After activation at pH 6.5, a first equilibrium was attained. When the pH was increased to 8 the equilibrium was displaced towards higher concentrations of activated complexes. A lowering of the pH resulted in a reversal of steroid-receptor complexes from the activated to the non-activated state. To clearly establish that this was not due to irreversible damage of the receptor, which would render it unable to bind to nuclei, it was shown that the complexes which had reverted to the non-activated state were still susceptible to activation. Regulatory events may thus exist which, for a given level of hormone and receptor, modulate the concentration of activated steroid-receptor complexes.

To investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic, metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment. Chlorthalidone (50 mg daily) was given for 14 days. Six patients received a normal-sodium diet and four a low-sodium (17 mmol/day) diet. All patients had a normal initial total body potassium (40K). The electrolyte balances, weight, bromide space, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone secretion rate were measured. In both groups a potassium deficit developed, with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment. In the normal-sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9, after which some potassium was regained; in the low-sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13. The normal-sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels; in the low-sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly but remained elevated. It is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic-induced potassium loss, presumably by an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, while sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion.

The effect of some centrally active drugs on the transmission of nerve impulses through the isolated cervical sympathetic nerve and superior cervical ganglion of the rabbit has been studied by recording both preganglionic and ganglionic responses to single square wave stimuli. Chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine and haloperidol have a greater axonal depressant action than the known local anaesthetics procaine and xylocaine. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are similar in local anaesthetic potency to procaine while meprobamate and sodium pentobarbitone possess only slight axonal depressant properties. Meprobamate, sodium pentobarbitone and possibly diazepam have ganglion blocking properties while procaine, chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, haloperidol and chlordiazepoxide reduce the ganglion potential by virtue of their preganglionic action.

The effects of the beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol (100 microgram/kg i.v.) and of the alpha-receptor blocking agent dihydroergotamine (50 microgram/kg i.v.) on hemodynamic responses to isoproterenol and norepinephrine (both 1--1024 ng/kg) were investigated in anesthetized dogs. The effects studied were: (1) flow in the ascending aorta and the coronary, common hepatic, gastroduodenal, splenic, cranial mesenteric, renal and femoral arteries: (2) maximal flow acceleration in the splenic, cranial mesenteric and femoral arteries; (3) maximal rate of change of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max). Propranolol shifted the dose-response curves for the isoproterenol-induced flow increases in the common hepatic, gastro-duodenal, and cranial mesenteric arteries to the right. It did not influence the flow responses to isoproterenol in the ascending aorta or the coronary, splenic, renal and femoral arteries. Propranolol prevented the decrease of arterial pressure evoked by isoproterenol. Propranolol shifted the isoproterenol-induced increase of LV dP/dt max and maximal blood flow to the same extent. Propranolol blocked the flow to the liver and gastrointestinal tract to a greater extent than the LV dP/dt max and maximal flow acceleration. Propranolol had no effect on the norepinephrine-induced increases in flow in the splenic, femoral and coronary arteries, but blocked the norepinephrine-evoked increases of flow accelerations and LV dP/dt max to the same extent. Dihydroergotamine inhibited the norepinephrine-induced increase in flow in the femoral artery and the decreases in flow in the hepatic, splenic, cranial mesenteric and renal arteries, and reversed the reduction of flow in the gastroduodenal artery. It is argued that dihydroergotamine may inhibit the increase in femoral flow through two mechanisms: (1) blocking the flow reduction to norepinephrine in the abdomen, and thereby passively shunting blood from the abdomen in preference to the femoral bed; (2) attenuating the norepinephrine-evoked reflexogenic femoral vasodilatation. It is concluded that: (1) propranolol is a beta-receptor blocking agent with a preference for blockade of isoproterenol-induced vascular effects; (2) norepinephrine-induced flow increases are not direct actions on vascular beta-receptors; (3) the increase of maximal blood flow accelerations after isoproterenol and norepinephrine is mediated by stimulation of cardiac beta-receptors; (4) dihydroergotamine is an alpha-receptor blocking agent particularly in the splanchnic vascular region.

1. The activity of cat semicircular canal and otolith afferents was studied during yaw and roll rotations, respectively, to examine their dynamic behavior. 2. A sinusoidal analysis of the canal afferent activities showed that their dynamic characteristics are similar to those of second order vestibular neurons, except for a two to three-fold lower absolute gain. This agrees with earlier studies using angular acceleration steps. 3. Both divisions of the eighth nerve were sampled so as to examine afferents from both the utriculus and sacculus. Within the range of inputs used (+/- 25 degrees lateral tilt), the presumed sacular afferents (inferior division) showed either a gamma- or beta-response. However, the gain of their response was generally much less than for the afferents of the superior division (mostly utricular). This behavior is to be expected on the basis of receptor orientations and the components of gravity acting upon the macular receptors. 4. In response to ramp changes in angular position, some otolith units showed a phasic-tonic response pattern, i.e., an overshoot followed by an adaptation to a new steady state level of activity. The majority of units showed predominantly tonic responses proportional to displacement. 5. During sinusoidal rotations the predominantly tonic units showed small phase leads of 0 to 15 degrees at 0.025 Hz which remained constant or decreased to 0 to -15 degrees at 1.0 Hz. The gains were flat or increased by up to 2 fold. The phasic-tonic units showed greater phase leads, 10 to 50 degrees, and gains which increased from 2 to 8 fold. 6. This behavior of otolith afferents suggests that they can provide information about both the magnitude and the rate of change of linear acceleration stimuli.

A review of anatomical and biochemical responses of the lung to high concentrations of oxygen leads us to postulate a biphasic adaptive response. The early phase entails a defense against life-threatening pulmonary edema engendered by destruction of oxygen susceptible cells forming most of the air-blood interface. This defense is brought about by type II alveolar cell replication to reform a continuous epithelial layer in the alveoli; its success would depend upon the rapidly with which this continuity can be reestablished. Factors favoring a successful defense would include an initial large population of type II cells or the ability of type II cells to divide fast enough to reestablish continuity before of oxygen-sensitive cells (type 1 alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells) proceeds to fatal pulmonary edema; both conditions probably exist in young animals, which are known to be more resistant to hyperoxia than old animals. The second phase of adaptation would require the development of increased tolerance of previously susceptible cells to continued exposure to high oxygen concentrations to prevent their total destruction. We postulate that here the development of new biochemical defenses or the augmentation of those previously present would play a major role.

1. In the posterior half of the pulvinar of cats anaesthetized with halothane and nitrous oxide, the majority of neurons were fired by ACh released with small electrophoretic currents. In the anterior part of that nucleus, ACh had more variable effects: excitation, depression or none. 2. In comparison with L-glutamate, DL-homocysteic acid and DL-aspartic acid, ACh appeared to be the most potent excitant. 3. ACh-induced discharges were easily and reversibly blocked by low doses of atropine. In most cases, ACh effects could not be blocked selectively by mecamylamine or dihydro-beta-erythroidine. 4. Nicotine failed to mimic ACh, whereas carbachol was a potent excitant and was readily blocked by low doses of atropine. 5. The histochemical reaction to acetylcholinesterase was moderate in the pulvinar. 6. These observations support the view that pulvinar cells differ from other thalamic cells.

Syrian hamster sera may be assayed for hemolytic complement (C) activity by standard procedures with sensitized sheep erythrocytes as used for human sera, but mongolian gerbil sera had higher complement titers when tested with sensitized guinea pig erythrocytes as target cells. The optimal conditions for in vitro testing of hamster C were pH 7.3, ionic strength 0.15, and presence of 1 micrometer of Mg2+ and 0.3 micrometer Ca2+. For gerbil C the optimum pH was 8, ionic strength 0.074, and the same concentration of Mg2+ and Ca2+ as for hamster. Incubation at 37 degrees C for 60 minutes yielded optimal results. Complement components in the serum of both species could be tested with commercially prepared intermediates of sheep erythrocytes pretreated with guinea pig C1 and human C4 respectively, using purified human C2 through 9 and standard methods applied for testing human C components. Both species have all nine components of the complement system.

A study was conducted to analyze 61 patients with benign hydatidiform mole (HM) who were admitted to the University College Hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria, during a 5-year period. The hospital incidence of HM was 1:205 pregnancies, and the condition was seen most commonly in young women, probably because early marriage is customary in our culture. Management of the condition generally was conservative because of the patients' youth. There was no correlation between HM and parity. Vaginal secondaries due to an embolic phenomenon were detected in 5% of the patients. Subsequent pregnancies followed within 6 months of treatment because the majority of the patients failed to heed medical advice to delay pregnancy for 2 years. No diagnostic problems were encountered in the patients who became pregnant during the follow-up period.

A statistical review of 113 cases of hydatidiform mole (HM) seen at Pahlavi University Hospital from January 1970 to December 1975 is presented. The incidence of the disease was found to be 1:314 pregnancies. In this study, 73.5% of the patients presumably had acceptable socioeconomic circumstances. The highest incidence of the disease was found in patients 15-25 years old, and it increased with parity. All patients presented with a period of amenorrhea and vaginal spotting. More than 50% of the patients sought treatment after 1-2 weeks of uterine bleeding. Signs and symptoms of the disease are discussed. The management of patients with HM and coexisting difficulties are presented.

The frequency of hydatidiform mole per delivery in the native Alaskan for fiscal years 1969 through 1974 was 1:257. Nutritional studies do not support the suggestion of protein deficiency as an etiologic factor. It is suggested that genetic factors may be involved.

A simple surgical technique for unification of a septate uterus is described. The septum and a small strip of fundus are removed with scissors inserted through two small fundal stabs, and the opening is closed with one mattress suture, which forms an anteroposterior suture line no more than 1 cm long. At the end of the operation an intrauterine contraceptive device is inserted to prevent uterine adhesions. The operation has several advantages: (a) it leaves a capacious uterine cavity of normal appearance, (b) it avoids large uterine incisions, and thus the possibility of postoperative adhesions or weak uterine scars, and (c) it avoids possible injury to the cornual ends of the Fallopian tubes. This article reports favorable results in 17 women treated with this surgical technique.

Sixty-four cases of rupture of the uterus were managed from March 1967 to March 1977. The maternal morbidity was 81.0%, and there were six maternal deaths (9.4%). Fifty-two patients (85.5%) had hysterectomies. The average hospital stay for patients who survived was 15.5 days. The fetal mortality rate was 89%. The etiology, diagnostic evaluation and the mode of prevention are discussed.

A vaccine capable of causing active immunity against one or more key elements of conception would have several advantages over currently available methods of fertility regulation. It would be amenable to mass use, would require only periodic follow-up, and would not require continuous user motivation. Although natural infertility attributable to immunologic factors has been amply documented, the natural mechanism has been only partially delineated. Consequently, researchers trying to develop a workable vaccine are taking various approaches. This report includes a discussion of autoimmune aspermatogenesis, anti-zona pellucida, anti-nonhormonal placenta-specific protein vaccines, and immunization against female and/or early embryonic antigens, including current approaches to the development of an anti-human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) vaccine. The potential advantages and disadvantages of the various immunologic methods are discussed, and the author concludes that although the problems associated with present methods of immunologic contraception are substantial they can be resolved.

One hundred nineteen Jamaican women who underwent myomectomy from 1964 to 1969 were followed up for 5 to 9 years. Infertility was the most common presenting complaint. Preoperative hysterosalpingograms were performed on 61 patients and were abnormal for the majority of these patients. Surgery revealed submucous fibroids in 41 patients and pelvic inflammatory disease in 51 patients. The pregnancy rate following myomectomy was 18.5%, but successful outcomes occurred in only 9.2% of the cases. Pregnancy was unsuccessful for all patients who underwent both myomectomy and tuboplasty. Twenty-three patients had a recurrence of myoma, and 13 of these underwent subsequent hysterectomy.

Labor was successfully induced by forewater amniotomy and oral administration of prostaglandin E2 tablets in 91.3% of 153 women with singleton pregnancies. Deliveries occurred within 12 hours for more than 90% of the successfully induced patients. Although not statistically significant, a higher pelvic score appeared to be associated with shorter induction-to-delivery intervals. There were no harmful side effects for either mother or baby; only 14.5% experienced minor side effects, primarily gastrointestinal upsets.

A clinical trial comparing two vaginal dose schedules of 15(S)15-methyl prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) methyl ester (4 or 6 mg) for preoperative dilatation of the cervix is described. The trial included 28 patients at 8-12 weeks' gestation. Vaginal pessaries containing either 1.0 mg (15 patients) or 1.5 mg (13 patients) of the prostaglandin analogue were administered every 3 hours (maximum, 4 doses). The success rates for the two groups were 93% and 100%, respectively. Sixty percent of the patients aborted before the planned vacuum aspiration. Minor side effects, primarily vomiting and diarrhea, occurred in approximately 80% of the cases and were more prominent with the higher dose pessary. It is concluded that the vaginal administration of 15(S)15-methyl PGF2alpha methyl ester is highly effective for preoperative dilatation of the cervix before suction curettage abortion.

Menstrual regulation (MR) (i.e., vacuum aspiration of the uterus with a small diameter, flexible cannula before pregnancy can be determined by a conventional pregnancy test) has been proven safe and effective in many clinics around the world. The present study, which we believe is the first such study of MR in Subsaharan Africa, shows that, for women in an urban African setting, MR is an acceptable backup for other contraceptive methods. Data on 507 MR patients treated at the University College Hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria, between January 1974 and April 1976, showed that the procedure was both safe and effective for 93.4% of the study subjects: there was an overall complication rate of 3.4% and MR failed in seven cases (3.2%). Data also showed that MR is an effective method of recruiting new contraceptive acceptors, as well as an effective back-up procedure in case of contraceptive failure.

A comparative study of the safety and effectiveness of metal (Purandare) versus plastic (Karman) cannulae for first trimester abortion was conducted on 400 women. Two hundred vacuum aspiration procedures were performed using each type of cannula. All aspirations were performed by a single physician, and patient follow-up was performed by a second physician. The complication rates, amount of retained tissue, rates of cannula obstruction and procedure times of the two cannulae were compared. Our findings showed no significant difference in any of these evaluation criteria for the metal and plastic cannulae.

The risk of hypernatremia and related postabortion complications resulting from the intraamniotic administration of a 20-25% hypertonic saline solution, a widely used procedure all over the world, prompted this trial of 5% saline. Midtrimester abortion was induced in 150 women with a 5% saline solution administered intraamniotically at the National Medical College, Calcutta, India, from August 1974 to October 1975. The abortion was complete within 48 hours in 90% of the cases. All the fetuses were delivered dead. In one case, hysterotomy was performed because of severe bleeding. The immediate complication rate was 36% (12% serious). The follow-up complication rate was 2%. One patient died on the seventh postabortal day due to severe, uncontrolled septicemia. The authors conclude that because this procedure is simple and low cost and because it reduces the risk of hypernatremia it should be a welcome addition to service programs in developing countries.

This study examines the impact of contraceptive counseling on 3 263 women hospitalized in Khartoum for treatment of incomplete abortion. The analysis which focused on education and parity/child desire, revealed that the counseling program produced contraceptive acceptance among 47.0% of those followed up. In spite of the counseling efforts, half of the women in this study did not accept contraception following the abortion-regardless of education or parity/child desire. It is difficult to determine why 50% of those who had recently undergone an incomplete abortion were willing to put themselves at risk again. Apparently, future efforts to increase the impact of counseling programs must also examine patients' motivation to accept (or not to accept) contraception.

From the array of sterilization procedures that are safe, simple and effective, the service provider must select procedures that fit his or her logistical criteria, which include the cost and maintenance of equipment, availability of supplies, and training of the requisite personnel. In this paper, these criteria are discussed for each of the various sterilization procedures. Information about female sterilization equipment for conventional postpartum laparotomy, minilaparotomy, colpotomy, laparoscopy, and culdoscopy is presented, together with facts about the related tubal occlusion techniques. The standard ligation techniques for male sterilization are compared with the newer electrocoagulation and thermocoagulation methods. A variety of methods for both female and male sterilization that are in the research stage are also mentioned. It is concluded that, from a programmatic point of view, vasectomy and postpartum ligation via laparotomy are the optimal sterilization procedures. For women who have not recently been pregnant, minilaparotomy with a standard tubal ligation technique is recommended, except in large teaching hospitals where laparoscopy can be performed efficiently.

From August 1975 through May 1976, a comparative study was made of the effects of sterilization by standard electrocoagulation and tubal ring application techniques. The two techniques were randomly assigned to 300 patients. Results show that standard electrocoagulation and tubal ring procedures can easily and safely be performed on an outpatient basis, using local anesthetics and analgesics. Rates of surgical complications for both techniques were clinically acceptable, although tubal risk patients had a higher rate. Pain during the procedure and during the immediate recovery period was more severe for tubal ring patients. Despite the higher incidence of surgical complications and pain associated with the ring, many physicians prefer this method of sterilization because it eliminates the possibility, inherent in electrocoagulation, of inadvertent serious electrical burns.

The majority of developing nations in the Third World (including Thailand) face similar medicosocioeconomic situations arising from uncontrolled population growth which outstrips developmental planning. One of the most effective medical means of combating these problems is surgical contraception. This study describes how the Ramathibodi National Training Program was developed and implemented in Thailand to increase the availability of sterilization services by training local physicians to perform the necessary operations. The success of this program is measured by the increase in the number of service delivery stations (182) and in the number of sterilization procedures performed (24 436 in a 32-month period).

A study was conducted to determine the water and nitrogen content of the placentae from anemic and nonanemic Nigerian women. The mean water content values were 84.9% and 85.3%, respectively, and this difference was not statistically significant. Placental nitrogen values were higher in anemic women than they were in nonanemic women, but the difference was not statistically significant. The results of this study indicate that placental hypertrophy which is associated with anemia is not due to water retention by the placenta.

A gravida with severe hemoconcentration was studied with intravenous urography because of right upper quadrant pain. She subsequently developed renal failure. The potential hazard of urography in the presence of a severe blood volume contraction state is noted.

This article presents 16 cases of coarctation of the umbilical cord, resulting in fetal death in utero in pregnant women of more than 6 months' gestation. Coarctation of the umbilical cord can occur in any phase of the gestational period and is not related to parity. The stricture of the cord is usually accompanied by torsion and characterized by a fibrosis of the Wharton's jelly and a thickening of the vascular walls which obstructs the fetoplacental circulation, leading to anoxia and fetal death. Although this entity must occur frequently, it is not often reported by obstetricians because the umbilical cord is not carefully examined in all cases of stillbirth.

Various pulmonary function changes were determined in twenty paediatric patients after a single oral dose of theophylline, ephedrine, or their combination in a double-blind crossover study. The possible contributions of guaifenesin and butabarbital, components of some formulations in clinical use, were also examined. Bronchodilatory efficacy in decreasing order, when compared to placebo, was observed for theophylline-ephedrine and theophylline (nearly comparable), and for ephedrine-butabarbital and ephedrine (nearly comparable). Butabarbital and guaifenesin did not enhance or decrease bronchodilatory effect. Adverse reactions appeared to be more frequently related to ephedrine intake, although no serious reactions were noted.

Seventy-six out-patient insomniacs participated in three different two-night, double-blind crossover trials investigating the hypnotic efficacy andsafety of triazolam. Triazolam 0.5 mg was compared to placebo in one trial conducted K Kay Okawa, MD, and triazolam 0.5 mg was compared to secobarbital 100 mg in trials conducted by K Kay Okawa, MD and George S Allen, MD. The results of the later two studies were combined and the data analyzed jointly. Triazolam 0.5 mg was found to be preferred and to be significantly better than both placebo and secobarbital 100 mg in the treatment of insomnia. Analysis of sleep questionnaire data showed triazolam to be superior to either placebo or secobarbital on the following parameters: how much the medication helped the patients sleep; onset of sleep; duration of sleep; and number of nocturnal awakenings. No differences were observed between treatments in any trial with regard to the patient's feeling of alertness the next morning. The side-effects reported for all treatments did not significantly interfere with the patient's ability to function.

The short-term hypnotic efficacy of triazolam was compared to that of flurazepam and placebo in 120 out-patient insomniacs. Each patient was studied with a two-night, double-blind crossover trial. Triazolam (0.5 mg) was compared to placebo and flurazepam (30 mg). Triazolam (0.25 mg) was compared to flurazepam (15 mg and 30 mg). Triazolam (0.5 mg) was preferred to both placebo and flurazepam (30 mg). Triazolam (0.5 mg) was superior to placebo in improving quality of sleep, shortening sleep onset, increasing sleep duration, and reducing the number of night-time awakenings. Triazolam (0.5 mg) was superior to flurazepam (30 mg) in speeding sleep onset and increasing the quality of sleep. Triazolam (0.25 mg) was preferred to flurazepam (15 mg) and was significantly better than flurazepam on all sleep questions. Triazolam (0.25 mg) was preferred by more patients than flurazepam (30 mg) and was judged equally efficacious on individual sleep questions. Reports of side-effects were minimal for both drugs.

In the years 1973 and 1975 mosquitoes and some other Diptera (Tabanidae, Simuliidae, Hippoboscidae) were tested for virus. 13,924 mosquitoes, 75 horseflies and 60 blackflies were processed in 1973. Five strains of Tahyna virus were isolated from mosquito species Aedes vexans. 3,378 mosquitoes and 12 sheep keds were tested for virus in 1975. Twelve strains of Calovo virus were isolated from Anopheles maculipennis and one strain of Tahyna virus was obtained from Aedes vexans mosquitoes.

Preventive medicine and primary health care, rather than advanced medical technology, appear to be the focus of health care delivery in China. In fact, the author says, one could imagine a decision being made not to install a CT scanner so that more physician extenders could be trained to improve nutritional standards, help eliminate infectious diseases, and provide health education information to people who would not otherwise be exposed to these services.

By isoelectric focusing at pH 3.5--9.5, Kühnl and Spielmann (1977) recently demonstrated a new genetically determined serum protein polymorphism designated 'Hpa' because of an apparently specific reaction with antihaptoglobin. In this study the polymorphism was reproduced, but the components were found to focus at pH 5.8, which is different from the pI of haptoglobin, and immunologic relation to haptoglobin could not be confirmed. Using pure transferrin as a reference, the results of isoelectric focusing, crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and immunofixation indicated that the polymorphic components were identical to transferrin. This polymorphism does not correspond to the already known transferrin polymorphism, as the two usual genes, tentatively designated Tf1 and Tf2, in my population sample (n = 132) were 0.19 and 0.81, and, further, all individuals except three in the sample belong to type Tf-C.

Conventional methods of organ culture have proved unsatisfactory for mammalian lung because of the rapid collapse of the tissue and the loss of its normal structure. In an effort to circumvent this problem and to provide a means for visualizing the cellular relationships throughout the culture period, respiratory organs consisting of trachea and lungs of fetal or hysterectomy-derived 1- to 4-week-old pigs were embedded in warm 3% Noble agar in phosphate buffer silicone solution and cooled to firmness. By use of a described cutting device, the respective organs were sliced into thin, 0.5- to 1.0-mm tracheal ring or lung explants. These organ sections then were cultured by exposure to alternate gaseous and liquid-medium phases by rotation (12 rev per hr) in sealed Leighton tubes fitted in a described rotator. In short-,erm culture experiments, explants were best maintained in a culture-support medium containing Eagle's minimal essential medium, 20% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% lactalbumin hydrolysate, and other supplements in a pH range of 6.5 to 8.2, and a NaCl concentration of 0.1 M or less. By bright-field and scanning-electron microscopy, tracheal ring and lung explant cultures incubated for 2 months showed intact, uniform and active ciliated epithelial surfaces which compared favorably with those of fresh preparations. The lung cultures showed alveoli that remained expanded, and the cellular integrity of the tissues remained normal in appearance. This new method provides respiratory organs as continuous records with exceptional cellular clarity and readily available for histological processing. The organ cultures lend themselves well to pathogenesis studies in which subtle cellualr changes or a sequence of changes induced in pulmonary tissues are difficult to observe in the host.

Most reported experimental studies concerning the effect of splenectomy in animals have shown enhanced mortality from pneumococci injected either intravenously or intraperitoneally. We have developed a laboratory model in which mice are exposed to type III Streptococcus pneumoniae via an aerosolized atmosphere, thus closely approximating the route of human infection with this organism. Ninety-one male Swiss mice (mean weight 26 g) were divided into three approximately equal groups of control, sham-operated, and splenectomized animals. Two weeks later they were exposed for 30 min in individualized compartments within a confined chamber to an aerosolized atmosphere producing a uniform challenge of 5.9 X 10(9) colony-forming units per ml of pneumococci. A statistically significant increase (P less than 0.01) in mortality was demonstrated in the splenectomized group over the pooled sham-operated and control groups. The animal model used in these investigations can be applied to the study of infections acquired by the respiratory route in numerous experimental designs.

Pathogenic mycoplasmas adhere to and colonize the epithelial lining of the respiratory and genital tracts of infected animals. An experimental system suitable for the quantitative study of mycoplasma adherence has been developed by us. The system consists of human erythrocytes (RBC) and the avian pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum, in which membrane lipids were labeled. The amount of mycoplasma cells attached to the RBC, which was determined according to radioactivity measurements, decreased on increasing the pH or ionic strength of the attachment mixture. Attachment followed first-order kinetics and depended on temperature. The mycoplasma cell population remaining in the supernatant fluid after exposure to RBC showed a much poorer ability to attach to RBC during a second attachment test, indicating an unequal distribution of binding sites among cells within a given population. The gradual removal of sialic acid residues from the RBC by neuraminidase was accompanied by a decrease in mycoplasma attachment. Isolated glycophorin, the RBC membrane glycoprotein carrying almost all the sialic acid moieties of the RBC, inhibited M. gallisepticum attachment, whereas asialoglycophorin and sialic acid itself were very poor inhibitors of attachment. Only part of the (125)I-labeled glycophorin bound to mycoplasmas could be removed by neuraminidase or by exchange with unlabeled glycophorin. It is suggested that glycophorin, representing the isolated major RBC receptor for M. gallisepticum, binds to the mycoplasmas both specifically, through its sialic acid moieties, and nonspecifically, through its exposed hydrophobic polypeptide moiety.

Exogenous and endogenously generated reduced pyridine nucleotides caused marked stimulation of O(2) uptake when added to treponemal cell-free extracts, which indicated that terminal electron transport was coupled to the consumption of O(2). Oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was shown to correlate stoichiometrically with O(2) reduction, suggesting that NADH was being oxidized through a mainstream respiratory chain dehydrogenase. Oxygen evolution in treponemal extracts was observed after the completion of O(2) uptake which was stimulated by exogenous NADH and endogenously generated reduced NAD phosphate. Oxygen evolution was inhibited by both cyanide and pyruvate, which was consistent with O(2) release from H(2)O(2) by catalase. The addition of exogenous H(2)O(2) to treponemal extracts caused rapid O(2) evolution characteristic of a catalase reaction. A spectrophotometric assay was used to measure ATP formation in T. pallidum cell-free extracts that were stimulated with NADH. P/O ratios from 0.5 to 1.1 were calculated from the amounts of ATP formed versus NADH oxidized. Phosphorylating activity was dependent on P(i) concentration and was sensitive to cyanide, N, N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. Adenine nucleotide pools of T. pallidum were measured by the firefly luciferin-luciferase assay. Shifts in adenine nucleotide levels upon the addition of NADH to cell-free extracts were impossible to evaluate due to the presence of NAD(+) nucleosidase. However, when whole cells, previously incubated under an atmosphere of 95% N(2)-5% CO(2), were sparged with air, ATP and ADP levels increased, while AMP levels decreased. The shift was attributed to both oxidative phosphorylation and to the presence of an adenylate kinase activity. T. pallidum was also found to possess an Mg(2+) - and Ca(2+) -stimulated ATPase activity which was sensitive to N, N' -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. These data indicated a capability for oxidative phosphorylation by T. pallidum.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of covert conditioning procedures in the outpatient treatment of drug addicts who wished to decrease or cease use of drugs. A desensitization design proved unsuccessful in reducing craving in an opiate user with a 2-year history of abuse. Three sensitization designs with addicts who had abused opiates from 2 to 13 years produced no more than a temporary decrease in drug craving or taking. Although there appeared to be some potency in the application of covert aversive counterconditioning and mixed aversive conditioning, the procedures were not capable of producing an enduring decrease in drug craving or taking in any of the subjects. Problems in the outpatient treatment of drug addicts using covert conditioning procedures are discussed. Recommendations for further study are made, with an emphasis on use of a multiform approach.

Three different combinations--the Eisenberg solution, Uralyt-U and Magurlit--have been compared for their litholytic effect on urate calculi in a homogeneous patient material. Magurlit and Uralyt-U have been found superior to the Eisenberg solution, insofar as they are dispensed in a hygienic form easy to handle and require for the production of the litholytic pH levels a shorter time than does the Eisenberg solution. In opposition to other citrate combinations, Magurlit may be used with success even if the urate calculus contain an additional component, unless its distribution is unfavourable and its proportion exceeds 15 to 20%.

Trimethroprim, erythromycin, ampicillin, and rosamicin, a new macrolide antibiotic, were administered to dogs by constant intravenous infusion. Their concentrations in plasma, urine, vaginal and urethral secretions, saliva, and tears were determined by bioassay. Trimethoprim, rosamicin, and, to a lower degree, erythromycin were concentrated in the secretions of the vagina and the urethra whereas the ampicillin concentrations in these secretions never exceeded the simultaneous plasma concentrations. Inasmuch as rosamicin and trimethoprim have antibacterial spectra well suited for the treatment of bacterial urethritis and vaginitis they should be investigated clinically in this respect.

The pattern and some substrates characteristic of the rat brain 5'-nucleotidase were studied using the isoelectric focusing technique, which revealed that the enzyme is present in a single form in hippocampus extracts. An alkaline phosphatase, which is also able to split nucleoside monophosphates, is not active at neutral pH values. The isoelectric points were found to be 6.4 +/- 0.1 for the specific 5'-nucleotidase and 6.8 +/- 0.1 for the phosphatase.

At present soluble NADP-dependent dehydrogenases are histochemically demonstrated in three different ways: according to the standard method incubation in aqueous media leads to the precipitation of formazan, the formation of which depends entirely on the presence of endogeneous NADPH2-tetrazolium reductases. With the two more recently established methods these reductases are by-passed with the use of intermediate electron acceptors incorporated in the medium. In addition, enzyme diffusion is inhibited either by an increased viscosity of the medium (PVA) or by a semipermeable membrane separating the medium from the section. Depending on the technique applied different distribution patterns have been described. By altering the concentrations of substrates, coenzyme, tetrazolium salt and cytochrome oxidase inhibitor, it was possible to improve both the PVA and membrane methods. Although similar results were obtained, because of its advantages the PVA method is recommended in this report and a detailed description is given. Using the latter for the demonstration of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), malic enzyme (ME) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), characteristic distribution patterns were obtained in the liver parenchyma of male and female rats. For the first time a high G6PDH activity could be demonstrated in nonparenchymal cells which are mainly found in zone 1 of the liver acinus.

The presence of 1% agar in the fixation and substrate solutions for the histochemical demonstration of thiamine pyrophosphatase (4.4 mM TPP; 3.6 mM Pb2+; 0.025 Tris-maleate buffer, pH 7.2) clearly facilitates the localization of the enzyme in Golgi apparatus in cold microtome sections prepared from unfixed specimens.

A study was made of the accumulation of the strongly fluorescent 2-carboxymethyl-6,7-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolinium compound (2-Carb. Me-DIQ) derived from the condensation reaction of dopamine with glyoxylic acid in endocrine cells possessing the capacity to take up and store biogenic monoamine precursors. Thin-layer chromatographic studies of urine showed that 2-Carb. Me-DIQ was metabolized into two strongly fluorescent metabolites, possessing at least one hydroxyl group in the phenol moiety of the molecule, which were excreted in urine together with the parent compound. Histochemical observations, however, indicated that the tissue fluorescence showing maximal emission at 480 nm was due to 2-Carb. Me-DIQ. Generally, the injection of 2-Carb. Me-DIQ induced a strong fluorescence in those tissue components possessing the extraneuronal uptake mechanism of catecholamines. In the endocrine cells strong fluorescence was seen in the pineal glandular cells and in some cells of the pars distalis of the hypophysis, of which some cells also took up DL-5-HTP, as was seen following formaldehyde vapour treatment. No accumulation of 2-Carb. Me-DIQ was observed in the pancreatic islet cells, the C cells of the thyroid gland or the tracheal enterochromaffin-like cells. These findings lead to the conclusion that biogenic monoamines in the cells of the pars distalis of the hypophysis might use the phenolic moiety of the molecule to bind to some intracellular receptor. Thus, the pars distalis cells may have an intracellular binding mechanism for biogenic monoamines that is different from other endocrine cells showing the uptake and storage of biogenic monoamines. On the other hand, the findings gave further support to the suggestion that in the pancreatic islet cells, the thyroidal C cells and the tracheal enterochromaffin-like cells biogenic monoamines are stored by a mechanism in which the basic, positively charged amino group of biogenic monoamines is bound electrostatically to the anionic, negatively charged carboxyl group of a hormone storage granule. The pars distalis cells and the pineal glandular cells seemed to take up amines and amine derivatives in a similar manner. This suggests that in the pars distalis cells, too, biogenic monoamines have an active metabolism and possibly some regulative role in hormone synthesis and/or secretion.

A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of low levels (less than 1 microgram/ml) of the basic metabolite of bezitramide, 1-(4-piperidinyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one, in human urine is described. Special attention is given to the separation from the basic metabolite of droperidol, a drug frequently co-administered with bezitramide.

A combined informant questionnaire and interview survey of self-injurious behavior (SIB) at a large state facility for the retarded was conducted independently three times over a 3-year period. Prevalence consistently was about 10% of the population. SIB cases tended to be younger and institutionalized longer than the rest of the population. Severe cases had a longer history of chronic SIB. SIB cases had more seizure disorders, severe language handicaps, visual impairments, and severe or profound retardation than the rest of the population. They appeared to fulfill most of the Rutter (1966) criteria for autism. But unlike the severely autistic, there was little relation of sex to incidence of SIB. Over 90% of SIB cases changed status over 3 years, suggesting that SIB was amenable to behavior modification in most cases (94%). Psychotropic behavior control medications helped in some intervention programs (32%). SIB remitted spontaneously in 21% of SIB cases where there had been no behavioral or drug intervention.

The biochemical phenotype of rodA mutants was not affected by the simultaneous presence in double mutants of the lyt gene which makes them 90 to 95% deficient in autolysin action. The only morphological effect of this deficiency on the expression of the rod gene was that both the rod and the coccal forms of the mutant failed to separate and grew as long chains of cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis stopped the increase in peptidoglycan that occurred when the growth temperature for the mutants was raised to 45 degrees C. These observations support the idea that a derepression of peptidoglycan synthesis occurs at this temperature. The increased amount of cellular peptidoglycan at the higher growth temperature is not likely to be the result of the concomitant switching off of autolytic enzyme action.

The requirement of ATP for the methyl coenzyme M methylreductase in extracts of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was found to be catalytic; for each mol of ATP added, 15 mol of methane was produced from methyl coenzyme M [2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonic acid]. Other nucleotide triphosphates partially replaced ATP in activation of the reductase. All components of the reaction were found in the supernatant fraction of cell extracts after centrifugation at 100,000 X g for 1 h; optimal reaction rates occurred at 65 degrees C, at a pH range of 5.6 to 6.0, and at concentrations of ATP and MgCl2 of 1 mM and 40 mM, respectively. Chloral hydrate, chloroform, nitrite, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and viologen dyes (compounds known to inhibit methanogenesis from a variety of substrates) were found to inhibit the conversion of methyl coenzyme M to methane. Methyl coenzyme M methylreductase was shown to be present in a variety of methanogens.

Interactions can arise from serial or simultaneous administration of 2 or more drugs. Interactions with other medications can enhance or diminish either the clinical usefulness of a drug, or its toxic effects. Interactions can arise from changes in absorption, protein binding, metabolism, excretion or activity at a common site of action. Drug interactions of clinical interest to psychiatrists are described. The drugs include: stimulants, neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lithium, anticonvulsants, and sedatives and hypnotics.

31P-nuclear magnetic resonance was applied to living muscles of bullfrogs, and the time courses of metabolic changes of ATP, creatine phosphate, inorganic phosphate, and sugar phosphates were studied under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. A decrease in creatine phosphate was observed in the resting muscle under anaerobic conditions with a concomitant decrease in the intracellular pH, while the ATP level remained constant. With the use of 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene and iodoacetic acid, ATP disappeared quickly. When the resting muscle was perfused with oxygen-saturated glucose-Ringer's solution, the amount of creatine phosphate increased gradually. These findings indicate that anaerobic glycolysis is insufficient for even the resting energy consumption whereas oxidative phosphorylation is sufficient. The effects of tetanic stimulation on living muscles were also studied. When glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation were suppressed, the intracellular energy store was depleted by the tetanic contraction. Anaerobic glycolysis produced rapid recovery of the energy store level, although it was insufficient to reach the initial level. Aerobic oxidative phosphorylation produced sufficient energy to reach the initial level, and this level was never exceeded. This finding suggests the existence of a regulatory mechanism for the energy store level.

A specific endonuclease involved in the processing of tRNA precursors was isolated and partially purified from the posterior silk gland of Bombyx mori, and designated as RNase P.Bmo. This enzyme was shown to catalyze the conversion of 4.5 S precursor RNA to 4.1 S RNA by trimming the 5'-additional segment from the precursor RNA. RNase P.Bmo required divalent cations, Mg2+ or Mn2+. In the presence of these divalent cations, K+ or NH4+ activated the RNase P.Bmo reaction. Optimum pH was observed around 8.0. Ribosomal RNA's and mature tRNA from the silk gland were not cleaved by RNase P.Bmo. A 4.5 S precursor RNA fraction containing formycin, an adenosine analog, was less susceptible to RNase P.Bmo than the normal one. These results indicate that RNase P.Bmo has a high substrate specificity. An additional nuclease(s) was isolated. This activity was assumed to remove the extra 3'-segment of the 4.5 S precursor RNA.

1. Acetate kinase [EC 2.7.2.1] from an thermophile, B. stearothermophilus, was purified and crystalized. 2. This enzyme was shown to be a tetramer of identical subunits which had a molecular weight of about 40,000. Amino acid analysis showed no SH group. By analyzing the CD spectrum it was deduced that this enzyme is composed of 36% beta-structure, 21% alpha-helix and 43% unordered structure. 3. This enzyme shared many common enzymatic properties with the counterpart from mesophiles, i.e. pH optimum, substrate specificity, requirement of metal ions and essential amino acid residues necessary for the catalytic activity. However, this enzyme was remarkably thermostable. 4. A plot of the reaction velocity against the concentration of acetate, ADP or acetyl phosphate gave a curve of the Michaelis-Menten type. However, such a plot against ATP gave a sigmoid curve, suggesting a homotropic allosteric nature of the enzyme. 5. From the results of chemical modification it was deduced that an amino group and an imidazole group, at least, are involved in the active site of the enzyme.

Three components (GA, GB-1, and GB-2) of beta-glucosidase were detected in the culture filtrate of Pyricularia oryzae grown in a cellulose or cellulose derivative medium. Among them, GB-1 was induced most strongly. Purified GB-1 was homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and showed an approximately 1,400-fold increase of specific activity over the starting material. The molecular weight was determined to be 240,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. A similar value was also obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The enzyme contained a high proportion of acidic amino acids and mannose, and the isoelectric point of the enzyme was pH 4.15. The enzyme had a pH optimum of 5.5 and a temperature optimum at 55 degrees C. beta-Glucosidase activity was inhibited by Mn2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and glucono-delta-lactone. The enzyme split off glucose units one by one from the nonreducing ends of not only beta-glucooligosaccharides but also some beta-glucans, such as carboxymethylcellulose, laminaran, pustulan, and zeagallan. The affinity for cello- and laminari-oligosaccharides tended to increase in parallel with the chain length.

A calcium-activated neutral protease was purified 2,700-fold over the crude extract from chicken skeletal muscle. The purified protease migrated as a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with or without SDS. Its molecular weight was 80,000 and pH optimum for activity was 7.7. The activity required strictly the presence of calcium (optimum concentration: 1.8 mM) or strontium (optimum concentration: 10 mM) ions. The protease was inhibited by leupeptin, which is known to be a strong inhibitor of papain, cathepsin B, trypsin, and plasmin.

The interactions of a homogeneous preparation of rat liver dihydropteridine reductase with NADH, NADPH, NAD+, NADP+, and the 1-N6-ethenoadenine derivative of NAD+ have been investigated by fluorescence titration, circular dichroism, equilibrium dialysis, Sephadex G-25 chromatography, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The procedures indicate that the dimeric enzyme has a definite preference for NADH, but binds only 1 mol of this nucleotide per mol of enzyme. The binary complex of enzyme with NADH is only partially stable to exhaustive dialysis and gel electrophoresis, where it shows greater mobility (0.26) than the free enzyme (0.21); however, the complex can be isolated by Sephadex G-25 chromatography, and characterized with respect to its absorbance spectrum. No ternary complexes are observed when samples of reductase, preincubated with excess NADH, and either the reaction product, 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine, or the inhibitor, methotrexate, are subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Mutants of Bacillus megaterium displaying malate-driven ATP synthesis resistant to uncouplers of oxidative posphorylation are further characterized. Both the pH gradient and electrical potential generated across the membrane by malate respiration are equally sensitive to uncouplers in the wild type and uncoupler-resistant mutants. The mutants possess 0 to 10% of the wild type ATPase activity which is not activated by pretreatment with heat or trypsin. Despite this inability to measure ATPase activity, the mutants demonstrate acid-pulse-driven ATPase synthesis which is sensitive to uncouplers as well as malate-driven ATP synthesis which becomes uncoupler sensitive at pH 5.5. N,N' -Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and valinomycin plus potassium inhibition of ATP synthesis is reversed by uncouplers in the mutants but not in the wild type. The data support the existence of a specific site on the ATPase complex for uncoupler binding which, if altered by mutation, affects uncoupler binding to the complex. The retention of malate-driven ATP synthesis in the absence of a significant pH gradient or electrical potential suggests that an alternative intermediate is involved in coupling oxidation to phosphorylation.

The coelomic cells of the polychaete annelid Glycera dibranchiata contain two hemoglobins. The monomer hemoglobin fraction is composed of one major component and two minor components as determined by starch gel electrophoresis and isoelectrofocusing, but is homogeneous as to subunit size as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The polymer hemoglobin fraction has and initial molecular weight of Mn = 125,000 as determined by osmometry, but exhibits an increased state of aggregation upon storage. The quaternary structure of the polymer is constituted of monomeric subunits in a non-covalent state of aggregation as demonstrated by its subunit dissociation inthe presence of propyl urea. The oxygen affinity of the polymer is lower than the monomer but increases with deaggregation. The Bohr effect is present only in the polymer. Cooperativity is also characteristic of the polymer and is pH-dependent. Interestingly, cooperativity increases with intermediate states of polymer deaggregation. By far, the main organic phosphate component of the coelomic red cells is ATP accompanied by small amounts of ADP and GTP. No modulating effect of ATP on the oxygen equilibrium of either polymer or total hemolysate was found.

In order to label phosphate binding sites, unadenylylated glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli has been pyridoxylated by reacting the enzyme with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate followed by reduction of the Schiff base with NaBH4. A complete loss in Mg2+-supported activity is associated with the incorporation of 3 eq of pyridoxal-P/subunit of the dodecamer. At this extent of modification, however, the pyridoxylated enzyme exhibits substantial Mn2+-supported activity (with increased Km values for ATP and ADP). The sites of pyridoxylation appear to have equal affinities for pyridoxal-P and to be at the enzyme surface, freely accessible to solvent. At least one of the three covalently bound pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate groups is near the subunit catalytic site and acts as a spectral probe for the interactions of the manganese.enzyme with substrates. A spectral perturbation of covalently attached pyridoxamine-P groups is caused also by specific divalent cations (Mn2+, Mg2+ or Ca2+) binding at the subunit catalytic site (but not while binding to the subunit high affinity, activating Me2+ site). In addition, the feedback inhibitors, AMP, CTP, L-tryptophan, L-alanine, and carbamyl phosphate, perturb protein-bound pyridoxamine-P groups. The spectral perturbations produced by substrate and inhibitor binding are pH-dependent and different in magnitude and maximum wavelength. Adenylylation sites are not major sites of pyridoxylation.

The [14C]methylamine distribution method was utilized to measure the internal pH of isolated serotonin containing granules of pig blood platelets under varying conditions. The granules used were isolated by a new protocol which stressed platelet rupture under controlled conditions and preservation of isotonicity throughout the isolation procedure, In a well buffered external medium, pH 6.85, The deltapH was measured as 1.11 with the internal pH being found acidic (pH 5.74). Increasing the external pH produced a corresponding increase in the deltaH. The pH gradient could be collapsed by the addition of ionophores and uncouplers which are known to transport protons across biological membranes. In addition, the deltapH was constant for granules suspended in various ionic media, thus suggesting that the deltaH did not arise secondarily due to the establishment of a Donnan equilibrium. The existence of the acidic intragranular space is discussed with respect to previous ancillary findings. Also, an explication of the possible physiological significance of the deltaH is presented.

Previous studies with protein tracers have shown that the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium of the bone marrow is endocytic. The endocytosis occurs through the formation of large bristle-coated vesicles (LCV). The anionic charge distribution in this process was examined at the luminal surface of the endothelial cell, At pH 1.8, colloidal iron (CI), native ferritin, and polycationic ferritin (PCF) are bound by the luminal surface of the endothelial cell, but not at the sites of LCV formation. PCF used over a pH range of 1.8--7.2 (CI is unstable at higher pH levels) revealed LCV binding of this agent in increasing manner from pH 3.5 upwards. PCF binding at low pH (1.8) at the endothelial cell surface was markedly reduced by neuraminidase. Neuraminidase did not reduce PCF binding by the endothelial cell surface nor by the LCV at higher pH levels. It is concluded that the luminal surface of the endothelial cell has exposed sialic acid groups which are absent or significantly diminished at endocytic sites. The free surface of the endothelial cells as well as the sites of endocytosis have, in addition, anionic material with a pKa higher than that of sialic acid (pKa 2.6). These anionic materials may be different at the sites of endocytosis as compared to those present at the free cell surface.

Simian papovavirus SA12 agglutinated human, guinea pig, and chicken erythrocytes. SA12 hemagglutinin was most effectively released from debris of infected tissue culture cells at an alkaline pH.

The urinary bladder of the fresh-water turtle acidifies its contents by actively transporting H(+) ions across the luminal membrane. It is known that the H(+) transport system is dependent upon oxidative metabolism and the substrate glucose; however, the specific biochemical events resulting in H(+) translocation have not been identified. This study examines the relationship between active H(+) transport and a specific oxidative pathway of glucose metabolism, the pentose phosphate shunt. To investigate this relationship the metabolic and transport rates were simultaneously measured under several well-defined conditions. When H(+) transport was inhibited by either the application of an opposing pH gradient or by acetazolamide, glucose metabolism by the pentose phosphate shunt declined. Conversely, stimulation of H(+) transport by either imposing a more favorable pH gradient or by CO(2) addition resulted in an increase in pentose phosphate shunt metabolism. Glycolytic activity, in contrast, was invariant with the maneuvers which altered the rate of H(+) transport. Additional experiments localized pentose phosphate shunt enzyme activity to the mucosal fraction of the bladder which is the cell layer responsible for acid secretion. The finding that the rate of glucose metabolism by the pentose phosphate shunt is related to the rate of H(+) transport suggests but does not prove that the pentose phosphate shunt may be an important metabolic pathway for H(+) transport by the turtle urinary bladder.

The relationship between the subcellular distribution of guanylate cyclase and tissue guanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) levels was investigated in rat testes after surgically induced unilateral cryptorchidism. Placement of one of a testis pair in the abdominal cavity results in loss of testicular weight and function in the abdominal testis whereas the remaining scrotal testis appears to be functionally normal. Within 5 days after surgery, tissue cGMP levels were increased by twofold in the abdominal testis. A fourfold elevation was noted from 10 to 30 days after surgery. Whereas the homogenate guanylate cyclase activity was only slightly elevated 10 and 20 days postoperatively, a 200% increase in the soluble guanylate cyclase activity was seen at 5 days. Between 10 and 30 days, the rise in activity was >250% (P < 0.01). An increase in soluble guanylate cyclase activity was noted when the data were expressed as per milligram protein, per milligram DNA or per whole testis. Conversely, particulate guanylate cyclase activity was reduced by 40% in the cryptorchid testis. Kinetic analysis of the soluble enzyme prepared from abdominal and scrotal testes yielded linear Line-weaver-Burke plots for both enzyme preparations with an identical K(m) for guanosine triphosphate, but a three-fold higher maximal velocity for the abdominal enzyme. When the soluble guanylate cyclases from both testes were mixed and assayed together, the activities were additive rather than exhibiting synergism or inhibition. These experiments indicate that the altered V(max) is not due to a transferable activator or inhibitor.An immunocytochemical technique was used to assess the cell type in which the alterations in cGMP metabolism occurred. Comparison of the scrotal and abdominal testes revealed that the abdominal testis exhibited enhanced cGMP immunofluorescence within the cells lining the inner aspect of the seminiferous tubule as well as tubular elements and interstitial cells. Thus, it is inferred that the correlated changes in soluble guanylate cyclase activity and cGMP levels occur in several of the cell types that remain viable within the cryptorchid testis.

To assess the adaptive value of the right-shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (decreased affinity for oxygen) observed in humans upon altitude exposure, the short-term physiologic responses to altitude-induced hypoxia were evaluated in two subjects with a high oxygen affinity hemoglobin (Hb Andrew-Minneapolis) and in two of their normal siblings. In striking contrast to normal subjects, at moderately high altitude (3,100 m) the high affinity subjects manifested: (a) lesser increments in resting heart rate; (b) minimal increases in plasma and urinary  erythropoietin; (c) no decrement in maximal oxygen consumption; and (d) no thrombocytopenia. There was no difference between subject pairs in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate response to altitude exposure. These results tend to contradict the belief that a decrease in hemoglobin oxygen affinity is of adaptive value to humans at moderate altitudes. Rather, they support the hypothesis that, despite disadvantages at low altitude, a left-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve may confer a degree of preadaptation to altitude.

Isolated rat lungs were ventilated with air and perfused with a blood-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution under conditions of net CO2 elimination in the lung. Some of the effluent perfusate was drawn through a stop-flow pH electrode apparatus, arriving at the electrode within 4 s after passing through the pulmonary capillaries. pH and temperature of the fluid in the electrode chamber were continuously monitored both before and after withdrawal was suddenly stopped. Little or no change was observed in the pH of the perfusate after flow was stopped, despite the fact that CO2 was eliminated in the lung, suggesting that the conversion of H2CO3 to CO2 in the blood-free perfusion fluid was markedly accelerated and the rise in pH was complete by the time the perfusate reached the electrode. Because the effluent perfusate was shown to be free of carbonic anhydrase activity, the catalysis must have occurred during transit through the isolated lung. When acetazolamide was added to the perfusate, a rise in the pH of the perfusate after stopping flow was consistently seen. These results suggest that the carbonic anhydrase of isolated lungs accelerates the conversion of H2CO3 to CO2 and enhances COW elimination as perfusate passes through the pulmonary capillaries, and that the enzyme may be present on the capillary endothelial surface.

Investigated whether variations in method of presentation of anxiety items (Es voice, E's taped voice, S's taped voice) will result in differences in autonomic arousal (as measured by self-report, galvanic skin responses, cardiac rate, blood pressure). Ss were 24 Naval Academy midshipmen. The procedure involved (1) training in deep muscle relaxation; and (2) measuring arousal after the presentation of anxiety-eliciting stimuli. Statistical analysis indicated that the influence of method of presentation was significant for galvanic skin response and self-reported anxiety. Comparison of cell means showed that verbal presentations were more effective in eliciting autonomic arousal than taped presentations. The results of this study provide partial evidence to support the conventional form of systematic desensitization as more effective than the newer automated or taped versions.

The properties of 5alpha-reductase have been compared in genital skin fibroblasts cultured from five patients from three families (Los Angeles, Dallas, and Dominican Republic) in which hereditary male pseudohermaphroditism has been established to result from deficient conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Despite the fact that 5alpha-reductase was immeasurable in a homogenate of epididymis removed from one of the Los Angeles patients, 5alpha-reductase activity was normal in intact fibroblasts and fibroblast extracts from both patients from the Los Angeles family. Although the apparent K(m) for testosterone was also near normal, the apparent K(m) for NADPH in these mutants is elevated some 40-fold above normal. Furthermore, the enzyme is not protected against denaturation at 45 degrees C by concentrations of NADPH that stabilize normal 5alpha-reductase, and in intact fibroblasts from these patients (but not from controls), enzyme activity decreases promptly when protein synthesis is inhibited. We conclude that the mutation in this family results in an unstable enzyme. In contrast 5alpha-reductase activity in fibroblast extracts from a patient from the Dominican Republic family is similar to that previously described in two members of the Dallas family, namely total enzyme activity is low at the optimal pH for the normal reaction, and the apparent K(m) for testosterone is some 20-fold higher than that of the controls. We conclude that the mutations in the Dallas and Dominican Republic families are similar and result in low activity of the enzyme as the result of a decreased affinity for testosterone.Thus, two distinct types of mutations can produce male pseudohermaphroditism due to deficient dihydrotestosterone formation.

In 30-min free-operant tests, the dopamine receptor blockers pimozide (.125, .25, and .50 mg/kg) and (+)-butaclamol (.1, .2, and .4 mg/kg) attenuated lever pressing for lateral hypothalamic brain stimulation. When discrete self-stimulation trials were offered in a straight alleyway, pimozide increased start box latencies, slowed running speeds, and reduced lever-pressing rates. However, performance early in both lever-pressing and runway sessions was normal; performance deteriorated as testing progressed, following patterns that paralleled those seen when animals were tested with reductions in the amplitude of stimulating current. Spontaneous recovery was obtained in both situations; experimenter-imposed 10-min time-outs caused renewed lever pressing and running. In contrast, alpha-noradrenergic receptor blockade by phenoxybenzamine (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) failed to produce extinction-like response patterns. These data support the view that central dopaminergic systems are important components of the neural mechanisms mediating reward.

Previous studies on the basis for the immunosuppressive potential of adrenal corticosteroids have stressed that the effects of these agents on immune functions depend on the animal species being considered, as well as the subpopulations of lymphocytes involved in the expression of immune functions examined. In the present work, we have evaluated the effect of a single dose of hydrocortisone on three different immunoregulatory functions that can influence the magnitude of an antibody response to Type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III) in mice; these functions include suppressor, amplifier, and helper activity that are dependent upon the presence of distinct subpopulations of thymus-derived (T) cells. The results obtained show that a single injection of a relatively large dose of hydrocortisone, when given at the time of priming with carrier, eliminated all evidence of carrier-specific helper T cell activity; hydrocortisone was also found to eliminate a significant amount of helper T cell activity when given after such activity had been generated. But, under the same experimental conditions, suppressor and amplifier T cell activities were unaffected, even in this steroid-sensitive species. Such selective sensitivity may account for some of the immunosuppressive potency of steroids.

The absorption of oral digoxin and of desmethyldiazepam, from its precursor clorazepate, was studied in seven patients who had received abdominal and/or pelvic radiation therapy for neoplastic disease. All patients were in remission and had normal renal function and no evidence of malabsorption. Single 0.5-mg doses of digoxin tablets and 15-mg doses of clorazepate were administered in the fasting state. Concentrations of digoxin (by radioimmunoassay) and desmethyldiazepam (by gas chromatography) were determined in multiple plasma samples and all urine collected during 24 hours after dosage. The mean (+/- S.E.) weight-normalized area under the 24-hour plasma digoxin concentration curve (WtN-AUC-24) in the patients (722 +/- 40 ng/ml-hr-kg) was similar to that in five normal controls (713 +/- 57 ng/ml-hr-kg), but 24-hour urinary excretion of digoxin in patients (54.5 +/- 4.4 microgram) was significantly less (P less than 0.025) than in controls (83.4 +/- 11.4 microgram). Neither age, sex, nor renal function explained the difference. In the clorazepate study, WtN-AUC-24 for desmethyldiazepam in the patients (187 +/- 19 microgram/ml-hr-kg) was significantly less (P less than 0.01) than in 15 normal control subjects (230 +/- 5 microgram/ml-hr-kg). Age and sex did not explain the difference. Thus, radiation therapy, or the underlying disease, is associated with malabsorption of these two drugs, possibly because of damage to gastric acid-secreting cells.

Age-related changes in hepatic triglyceride formation have been described in developing rats. Triglyceride formation was measured in vitro in the presence of [14C]glycerol-3-phosphate, palmitate, ATP, CoA, and Mg2+ by using liver homogenates and microsomal fractions derived from various age groups of animals. Triglyceride formation was most active in one-day-old rats and then decrease with age. The increase in triglyceride formation following birth was prevented by the administration of puromycin or by denying suckling. In addition, changes in plasma and hepatic triglyceride concentrations, were also determined as functions of age. These studies suggest that the age of the animal significantly influences triglyceride metabolism.

Six different R-factors conferring trimethoprim resistance had been isolated from a variety of sources. The trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductases (EC 1.5.1.3) from strains containing these R-factors were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation and DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography. The enzymes showed no significant differences in molecular weight, pH profile, substrate profile, heat sensitivity, inhibition profile and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. There was, however, considerable variation in the specific activity of these enzymes in the same bacterial host. When two Escherichia coli trimethoprimsensitive dihydrofolate reductases were examined as controls, considerable differences between their properties and those of the enzymes mediated by R-factors were detected. The data suggest that one trimethoprim resistance gene could be spreading through the bacterial population, possibly situated on a transposon.

An RNA polymerase activity has been demonstrated in purified rabies virions. Efficiency of the reaction is low since the rate of incorporation was equal to 3 to 5 pmol of uridine per hour, per mg of protein. As with other mammalian rhabdoviruses the optimal temperature was 31 degrees C. Unlike vesicular stomatitis virus, manganese could be substituted for magnesium as a divalent cation, at an optimum concentration of 10 to 20 mM.

Calcium chloride (5 to 20 mM) potentiated interferon production induced by rIn:rCn in L929 mouse fibroblasts up to a thousand-fold. Higher concentrations of calcium (20 to 65 mM) mixed with rIn:rCn were associated with increased cytotoxicity and a more acidic medium, but were effective in enhancing interferon production if preparations were adjusted to a uniform pH. Although calcium increased cellular binding of 3H-rCn:rIn, only a partial correlation between binding and interferon production was observed.

Poly (A) polymerase activity has been measured in crude cytoplasmic extracts of mouse L cells infected with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. After infection there is first a decrease in enzyme activity followed by an increase which itself precedes detectable virus RNA and protein synthesis. The activity of the enzyme then declines before the release of mature virions and cell death take place. The early inhibition of poly (A) polymerase activity is correlated with the virus-induced shut-off of cellular protein synthesis but it is not due to inhibition of the synthesis of cellular enzyme and occurs in the absence of virus replication. The poly (A) polymerase is not synthesized after infection and modification of its activity can be reversed late in the virus cycle. These results indicate that host poly (A) polymerase activity can be regulated by the virus and further show that there is a correlation between the modification of poly (A) polymerase activity and the biosynthesis of poly (A).

Guanylate cyclase activity has been studied in muscle of normal subjects and of patients suffering from muscular and neuromuscular diseases. In normal tissue a guanylate cyclase activity was found in both soluble and particulate fractions of homogenate. We found also that the kinetic analysis of the enzyme of soluble differed from that of particulate fraction. A decrease of guanylate cyclase activity in crude homogenate was observed in muscular dystrophies, in neuromuscular atrophies, and in inflammatory forms of muscle disease.

Patients with chronic renal disease had low plasma total tryptophan but an abnormally high proportion of this was in the free state. The subjects with encephalopathy had raised plasma free tryptophan, CSF tryptophan, and CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. CSF tryptophan correlated better with plasma free than with plasma total tryptophan. Plasma and CSF tyrosine concentrations were normal but CSF homovanillic acid was raised especially in subjects with encephalopathy. The possible significance of these changes in advanced renal disease is discussed.

The President of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons reviews the organization of the Association designed to represent neurosurgery and neurosurgeons. He summarizes the pertinent problems that the specialty has faced and with which it continues to deal, in persistent pursuit of its objective: to assure the highest quality of neurosurgical care for all.

Two patients, one with an autosomal and the other a sex-linked form of severe combined immunodeficiency, had more than 95% B cells in their peripheral blood. Despite an increased absolute number of B lymphocytes, the patients were unable to produce serum antibodies. In each patient, geno- or pheno-identical bone marrow transplantation was followed by the visualization of a thymus shadow and the appearance of both cellular and humoral functions. Chromosome of allotype studies showed that the T cell originated from the donor whereas serum immunoglobulins were synthesized by host B cells. In these patients the pathogenesis appears to be a selective defect of bone marrow precursor T cells without concomitant intrinsic B cell defect. The successful outcome of the graft in these two patients, who are now, respectively, 5 years and 11 months of age and free of infections, indicates that the preferred form of therapy in such patients is transplantation of bone marrow stem cells, which populate the thymus and mature slowly into T cells that cooperate fully with host B cells in synthesis of antibody.

The factors that affect the size of microcapsules and the oxidation of their benzaldehyde core have been examined. The pH of the preparation changed the overall size of the microcapsules which reached a maximum diameter at pH 4.1. The size of the core droplets also varied with the preparative pH and their oxidation rate depended on the bulk droplet size rather than their surface area. A rapid oxidation of benzaldehyde associated with the microcapsule wall resulted in a preliminary peak in the oxidation curve. Explanations for these phenomena are discussed.

The wetting of powders of acetylsalicylic acid, salicylic acid, phenacetin and paracetamol has been assessed using methanol--water mixtures to give a range of surface tensions. The results have been interpreted in terms of the critical surface tension, adhesion tension and spreading coefficients. The critical surface tension values are surprisingly low which may be due to adsorption of the methanol at the solid surface, exposing its CH3 group to the liquid. The adhesion tension and spreading coefficient values could be useful guides in formulation.

The antidepressant drug amitriptyline and two of its metabolites, nortriptyline and desmethylnortriptyline, each containing two 13C atoms, have been used to determine the sensitivity and selectivity of 13C-nmr spectroscopy for the detection of unchanged amitriptyline and N-desmethyl metabolites in the urine of animals dosed orally with the labelled drug. The resonance signals from the 13C atoms detected in the 13C-nmr spectrum of entire extract from a control 12 h rat urine sample to which 1 mg of each labelled compound had been added were easily detected, using an instrument accumulation time of 1 h. The 13C-nmr spectrum of an extract of hydrolysed urine from a dog that had received an oral dose of  [13C2]amitriptyline (30mg) exhibited signals that could be assigned to metabolites resulting from N-dealkylation and N-oxidation, as well as those bearing the intact amitriptyline side-chain. These assignments were confirmed by analysis of the same extract by g.c.--ms and h.p.l.c.

Significant correlation in 11 different 1,4-benzodiazepinones has been established between log k2 (the second order rate constant for the reduction of the "azepinones" by sodium borohydride) and their ED50 against leptazol-induced seizures in mice. The results suggest a possible involvement of the carobnyl group at the receptor site.

Six acidic metabolites were isolated from rat faeces and identified by gas chromatographymass spectrometry and proton magnetic resonance. Cannabinol-7-oic acid was the most abundant acidic metabolite isolated. Others present in decreasing order of prominence were 1"-hydroxy-, 4"-hydroxy-, 3"-hydroxycannabinol-7-oic acid, cannabinol-3"-one-7-oic acid and 2"-hydroxycannabinol-7-oic acid.

Isolated spontaneously beating atria from streptozocin diabetic rats were compared with those from controls. Diabetic atria were found to have reduced rates, increased forces of contraction and reduced sensitivity to the inotropic effects of noradrenaline, isoprenaline, tyramine and calcium. Positive chronotropic responses to tyramine were also reduced but those to noradrenaline and isoprenaline were increased suggesting that tyramine releasable stores of noradrenaline were reduced. Elevation of glucose concentration in the medium from 5.6 to 27 mM resulted in decrease of inotropic sensitivity to the agents used in both control and diabetic rat atria. Resting contractile force of control rat atria was reduced by the inclusion of either 22 mM 2-deoxyglucose, 10(-3) i.u. insulin ml-1 or 5 mM acetate in the medium. The rate was also reduced by medium containing 2-deoxyglucose but increased by insulin. 2-Deoxyglucose also reduced inotropic but increased chronotropic sensitivity to isoprenaline. Possible mechanisms responsible for the changes observed are discussed.

The effect of the drug Ru 20201 (1,2,3,4,4a,9b-hexahydro,-8,9b-dimethyl-4-[3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propionamido]dibenzofuran-3-one upon mechanically-evoked cough from the laryngopharyngeal and tracheobronchial areas in nine unanaesthetized cats has been examined. Inhalation of 2 ml of an aerosol of a 10% solution in water suppressed coughing for 30 min. The effect was greatest on the number of cough efforts. The expiratory component of cough was suppressed more than was the inspiratory one. The effect was greater on cough from the laryngopharyngeal than from the tracheobronchial area.

Variations of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the experimental antimalarial drug, alpha-dibutylaminomethyl-2,6-bis(p-trifluoromethylphenyl)-4-pyridinemethanol, were investigated throughout the pH region in concentrated sulfuric acid media and in n-hexane. The predominant prototropic species at physiological pH is the singly charged cation. In the pH 6--12 region, the structured fluorescence of the monocation is quenched with the concomitant appearance of a diffuse, long wavelength emission while the corresponding absorption spectra shift only slightly to longer wavelengths. Furthermore, the dibutylamino group exhibits an unusually low basicity. This behavior is explained as due to the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in the neutral molecule in the ground and lowest excited singlet states. A similar intramolecular hydrogen bond in the monocation is not spectroscopically visible.

The solubilities of naproxen, 7-methylsulfinyl-2-xanthonecarboxylic acid, 7-methylthio-2-xanthonecarboxylic acid, and their sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium salts were determined as a function of pH. The results on the solubility of naproxen and its salts were in excellent agreement with the theoretical profiles describing the relationship between pH values of the solutions and the dissociation constant of the acid. The solubilities of the two xanthonecarboxylic acids were higher at higher pH values than the values calculated when complete dissociation in solution was assumed. The influence of the salt species on the solubility of organic carboxylic acids, at and above pH values of complete ionization, cannot be predicted even qualitatively from equations used for alkali and alkaline earth metal salts.

The synthesis of (+/-)-2-(3'-tert-butylamino-2'-hydroxypropylthio)-4-(5'-carbamoyl-2'-thienyl)thiazole hydrochloride is described. The new compound antagonized the cardiovascular effects, such as positive chronotropic, positive inotropic, or depressor arterial blood pressure responses, elicited by intravenous isoproterenol; it was 9--14 times as potent as propranolol in anesthetized open chest dogs. The oral administration of the compound reduced isoproterenol tachycardia in conscious dogs. It was about five times as potent as propranolol in this test, with maximal action after 1 hr, and its duration was significantly longer than that of propranolol.

A rapid, sensitive, and specific method of analysis for atenolol is described. Metoprolol is used as the internal standard. Atenolol and metoprolol are extracted into 1-butanol--benzene. Interfering components present in palsma and urine, but not discolored saliva, are removed during an acid wash and reextraction into ether. Drug and internal standard are converted to the pentafluoropropionate derivatives, which are quantitated by GLC with electron-capture detection and characterized by chemical-ionization mass spectrometry. The method should be applicable to measurement of other beta-adrenergic blocking agents with similar structures.

1. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolic acid transport was studied across everted sacs of rat jejunal segments from control and whole body X-irradiated (700 rad) rats at 10(-5)M concentrations (at which optimum transport occurs) at various pHs.2. The folate transport from mucosal to serosal compartment was inhibited by about 55% in irradiated rat at the pH of the intestinal chyme (6.5). Extraneous ATP in the incubation system could restore the defective transport of the irradiated intestine.3. The maximum folate transport which occurred at pH 4.0 was not adversely affected by whole body irradiation. An acidic, pH dependent, passive uptake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid was observed.4. The normal absorption barrier of the small bowel was not disrupted by the acidification process as practically no uptake was observed with irradiated segments pretreated at pH 4.0 except in the presence of ATP.5. Leucine and serine transport at a zero concentration gradient indicated active transport mechanisms which were not affected by acidification. Their uptake was additively increased in the presence of glucose and ATP, further indicating that the normal physiology of the intestines was not affected by the acidification process.6. An intestinal mucosal cell surface ATPase was observed which was Mg(2+) dependent. It could hydrolyse solution phase ATP and thus generate the protons necessary for the acidification of a microenvironment where passive uptake of the neutral folate species could occur.7. The ATPase activity was inhibited about 90% by 50 mM-Na azide at pH 6.5. Below this concentration folate transport was also inhibited.8. Na azide did not inhibit folate transport at pH 4.0, suggesting that its inhibition of folate uptake at pH 6.5 is related to its inhibitory effect on ATPase, rather than on folate transport per se. ATPase activity was therefore essential for folate transport at the pH of the intestinal chyme.

The synthesis is described of a seris of derivaties of 1-(aryloxy)-3-(arylthioalkylamiho)propan-2-ols and 1-(alkylthioamino)- and 1-(aralkylamino)-3-(aryloxy)propan-2-ols. These compounds were investigated for their beta-adrenoreceptor blocking properties and their selectivity of action for the cardiac beta1 receptor. The structure-activity relationships are discussed with particular reference to the effects of the sulfur, sulfoxide, and sulfone groups on beta-adrenoreceptor blocking potency and selectivity.

The facile syntheses of important intermediates used in the preparation of the two potent dopaminergic argonists, 2-amino-6,7-dihydroxytetrahydronaphthalene (11) (referred to by some authors as ADTN) and its 5,6-dihydroxyl isomer 12, are described. Thus 6,7-dimethyoxy-2-tetralone has been prepared in two steps and 5,6-dimethoxy-2-tetralone in three steps both from commercially available materials. The effects of 11, 12, and the noncatechol analogue, 2-aminotetrahydronaphthalene (ATN), on radioactive neurotransmitter release have been studied in vitro using rat brain slices. It has been shown that both 11 and 12, at a concentraiton of 2 micron, cause a release of [3H]-DA and NA, 11 being more potent than 12 in releasing [3H]-DA. ATN (2 micron) was found to be inactive in these experiments which shows the importance of the catechol function in this uptake--release process.

The synthesis and stereochemistry of trans-N,N-diethyl-9,10-dimethoxy-1,3,4,6,7,11b-hexahydro[1,4]oxazino[3,4-a]isoquinoline-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (16) and a series of analogues are described. 16 and its (+) isomer had neuroleptic properties in the Sidman avoidance test in gerbils. A few closely related amides of the trans series were active but cis amides were inactive as neuroleptics.

Iodinated analogues 2, 7, and 8 were prepared from propranolol, practolol, and acebutolol in 30--50% yields. Radioisotopic exchange between carrier-free Na125I and the molten iodinated beta-adrenergic antagonist yielded the corresponding 125I-labeled product. The biodistribution in rats, determined at 15 and 60 min postinjection, indicated that the radioiodinated analogues of the cardioselective drugs practolol and acebutolol localized to a greater degree in the liver and heart than the analogue of propranolol. Conversely, [125I]iodopropranolol (2) was concentrated to a greater extent in the lungs than [125I]iodopractolol (7) or [125I]iodoacebutolol (8). Therefore, 123I- or 131I-labeled cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonists, such as 7 or 8, may prove useful as radiodiagnostic agents for the external imaging of the myocardium.

We have synthesized 2'(3')-O-(glycyl)-adenosine-5'-(O-methylphosphate), an analogue of the 3'-terminus of aminoacylated tRNA. A 0.4M solution of this compound maintained at pH 8.2, yields 5.5% of diglycine and 11.5% of diketopiperazine, in addition to the hydrolysis products glycine and adenosine-5'-(O-methylphosphate). Under the same conditions, glycine ethyl ester reacts much more slowly, but ultimately gives similar yields of diglycine and diketopiperazine. The aminolysis of 2'(3')-O-(glycyl)-adenosine-5'-(O-methylphosphate) by free glycine is relatively inefficient, but serine reacts 20 times more rapidly and yields up to 50% of N-glycylserine. The prebiotic significance of these reactions is discussed.

Carbamylcholine, acting via a pharmacologically specific receptor, had the ability to activate effector populations of spleen cells from female BALB/cfC3H and BALB/c mice; those cell populations were then significantly reactive in vitro against syngeneic tumor target cells but were only minimally reactive to normal syngeneic target tissues. The induced reactivity was inhibited by the muscarinic cholinergic antagonists atropine, scopolamine, and isopropamide, but not by the nicotinic antagonist d-tubocurare, and it appeared to involve both T-cell and non-T-cell effectors.

Sera from chickens naturally infected with Marek's disease herpesvirus (MDHV) form preciptin lines with at least two immunologically distinct soluble antigens designated MDHV-A and MDHV-B. Partial purification and characterization of the glycoprotein MDHV-A antigen was previously reported. MDHV-B was found predominantly in the sonically treated extracts of infected cells, in contrast to the predominantly extracellular MDHV-A. Analysis of these extracts from [14C]glucosamine-labeled cells by immunodiffusion with chicken anti MDHV-B serum negative for MDHV-A followed by autoradiography confirmed that MDHV-B was a common antigen between MDHV and herpesvirus of turkeys and revealed that it was also a glycoprotein. Because of their glycoprotein nature, both MDHV-A and MDHV-B bound to concanavalin A affinity chromatography columns and could then be eluted by alpha-methyl-D-mannoside and recovered for further analysis. Concanavalin A affinity chromatography was an excellent technique for initial purification of MDHV-A and MDHV-B, since approximately 5- and 15- fold purification, respectively, was achieved in a single simple step. MDHV-B was resistant to trypsin under conditions where MDHV-A was sensitive, but was similar to MDHV-A in resistance to pH 2.0 and to 1.0 or 2.0 M urea and 0.05% Brij 35. Partially purified MDHV-B was analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation, isoelectric focusing, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 in the presence of 1.0 or 2.0 M urea and 0.05% Brij 35 to purify the antigen and to determine its physical and chemical properties in comparison with those already reported for MDHV-A. MDHV-B had a much lower isoelectric point in pH 4,54, a higher sedimentation coefficient of 4.4S, and a greater molecular weight of 58,250. These data indicate that MDHV-B is physically distinct from MDHV-A antigen, although the size difference is not sufficient to allow for effective separation. In contrast, the isoelectric point difference of greater than 2 pH units makes isoelectric focusing an effective means of purifying the antigens free of one another. The four-step purification procedure achieved greater than 200-fold purification of MDHV-B. Immunization of rabbits with this highly purified antigen results in the preparation of antisera that appeared monospecific for MDHV-B in immunodiffusion.

The proteins of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were analyzed on the basis of charge as well as size in polyacrylamide gels containing urea and acetic acid. The phosphorprotein NS was resolved into two major species. The less phosphorylated NS1 species contained about 10% fewer phosphate residues than the second species, NS2. These two phosphorylated forms were compartmentalized both in the virus and in the infected cell cytoplasm. Cores from virions and the core-containing fraction of the infected cell cytoplasm contained only the NS1 form. All of the more highly phosphorylated NS2 form and some of the NS1 form were found to be free of cores, whether they were derived from virions or from the infected cell. Therefore, the degree of phosphorylation appeared to determine whether or not the NS protein became bound to VSV cores. Moreover, the amount of bound NS1 protein relative to nucleocapsids increased as the pH of the culture medium was raised from 6.6 to 7.4. Because an increased in pH increases VSV replication (Fiszman et al., J. Virol. 13:801-808, 1974; Palma and Huang, in W.S. Robinson and C.F. Fox, ed., Mechanisms of Virus Disease, ICN-UCLA Symposia, p. 87-100, 1974), the NS1 protein may either regulate overall VSV RNA synthesis or regulate the switch between transcription and replication.

Transient bone marrow suppression in two sisters followed ingestion of the sedative-hypnotic drug methyprylon. No other pharmacologic or environmental inciting factor common to both patients was identified. The mechanisms responsible could not be defined; abnormal suppression fo granulocyte progenitors by the drug in vitro was not demonstrable. It is postulated that a pharmacogenetic interaction may have been responsible for methyprylon-related bone marrow suppression in these two siblings.

Thromboembolic complication was correlated with the methods of anticoagulant therapy used in the patients with Starr-Edwards non cloth-covered or cloth-covered ball valve. A new anticoagulant therapy combining Bucolome with Warfarin has been used for the patients who were unable to be maintained in a suitable range of thrombotest Owren with Warfarin alone. The results obtained in this new therapy showed that the incidence of thromboembolism was reduced to 0.02 per patient year or less in the patients with Starr-Edwards ball valve as well as Björk-Shiley tilting disc valve.

We invesigated the influences of imidazole on the basal and the secretagogue-stimulated gastric acid secretion in isolated bullfrog gastric mucosa preparations and in anesthetized young chickens. Imidazoles (1 x 10(-4) g/ml) readily depressed the basal acid secretion in gastric mucosa in vitro. The inhibitory effect of imidazole was diminished considerably after washing out of the drug. The maximum acid secretion elicited by tetragastrin or bethanechol was completely antagonized by imidazole (1 x 10(-4) g/ml). The stimulatory action of histamine or dibutyryl cyclic AMP was also remarkably depressed in the presence of imidazole (3 x 10(-4) g/ml). after dibenamine pretreatment (5 x 10(-5) g/ml) for 60 min, the isolated gastric mucosa preparation became refractory to tetragastrin, bethanechol and histamine, but responded to dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Imidazole protected the histamine sensitivity against dibenamine blockade in the concentration of 5 x 10(-4) g/ml. In anesthetized young chickens, imidazole (200 mg/kg, s.c.) depressed tetragastrin- and histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion. The effects of the imidazole derivatives and several antagonists (metiamide, atropine, diphenhydramine, acetazolamide and 2,4-dinitrophenol) on acid production were compared with that of imidazole. From these results, it is concluded that imidazole has a potent antisecretory effect on the basal and the secretagogue-stimulated acid secretion.

A new technique for manufacturing single-barreled and double-barreled antimony pH microelectrodes is described. The results of investigations into the accuracy of antimony as a pH sensor disclosed that the pH-voltage response is: 1) within the physiologic range, principally the result of the hydrogen ion activity of the solution in which the voltage is being developed, 2) in part, qualitatively anion-dependent, 3) modified by the presence of significant amounts of at least carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen gases, and 4) markedly offset by fluctuations in temperature. Our results further indicate that the accuracy of antimony as a pH sensor is determined by the quality of the calibration procedure. We conclude that if the antimony electrode is to accurately determine the pH of a biological fluid, the pH calibration solutions must closely resemble the unknown biological fluid with respect to temperature, PO2, PN2, and types of buffering anions. A calibration procedure is described which can minimize errors with antimony pH estimations when measuring the pH of proximal tubular fluid of the mammalian kidney.

A primary melanoma of the small intestine is reported. A possible explanation of its origin according to the APUD cell concept is suggested. This concept may lessen the doubts and confusion whenever an intestinal melanoma is discovered and a primary tumor at one of the more common sites can reasonably be excluded.

The human fibroblast cell line WI-38 shows a gradual decline in glutamine synthetase specific activity with increasing age in culture. However, the level of functional enzyme per cell does not change with age. Heat inactivation profiles indicate that glutamine synthetase from younger cell cultures is more heat labile than that from older cultures. A possible explanation for these observations is that alterations in the glutamine synthetase molecule occur with increasing age of WI-38 cells in culture.

Chromatin-bound and soluble RNA polymerase subspecies have been isolated and fractionated by isoelectric focusing at various times (0, 6, 12 and 18 h) following auxin treatment of 4 day (responsive) and 8 day (unresponsive) soybean hypocotyls. Young 4 day seedlings displayed two well defined phases of auxin induced gene transcription. Phase I (6 h) evidenced the selective dissociation of many RNA polymerase subspecies from the chromatin complex which was accompanied by the retention of three class II enzymes. Phase II occurred after 12 h of treatment when the dissociated enzymes including some species which were soluble in the 0 h controls became re-associated with chromatin. These induced RNA polymerases may be responsible for the synthesis of auxin induced RNAs. In contrast, the unresponsive 8 day hypocotyl did not display two phases of auxin induction. Phase one, the dissociation of the chromatin bound enzymes, occurred at 12 h (compared to 6 h for the 4 day seedling) and was not followed by the later translocation of any soluble enzymes towards the chromatin complex. The results support earlier findings suggesting that the developmental "phasing out" of RNA polymerase subspecies limits the hormone induced growth response of this tissue and thus is regarded as an off switch for the transcription of such hormone controlled gene sequences.

Multiple antimicrobial resistance in pneumococci was detected in Johannesburg in July, 1977, and prompted an investigation of the prevalence of resistant strains in two hospitals. Carriers of Types 6A and 19A penicillin-resistant pneumococci, resistant to antibiotic concentrations ranging between 0.12 and 4 microgram per milliliter were found in 29 per cent of 543 pediatric patients and 2 per cent of 434 hospital staff members. Multiply resistant Type 19A strains, resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol, were isolated from 128 carriers, and were responsible for bacteremia in four patients. Isolates from 40 other carriers were resistant to penicillin alone or to penicillin and chloramphenicol or to penicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Pneumococci can be screened for penicillin resistance with a modified Kirby--Bauer technic; the strains with zones of less than 35 mm around 6-microgram penicillin disks or less than 25 mm around 5-microgram methicillin disks should be tested for sensitivity to penicillin by measurements of minimum inhibitory concentration.

Polygalacturonase, biomass, and ascospore production by four strains of Byssochlamys fulva cultured in laboratory media supplemented with glucose, sucrose, or fructose was studied over a 20-day incubation period at 30 degrees C. The production of polygalacturonase was variable, but most activity was detected between 4 and 8 days in 1% sugar media at an initial pH of 4 or 5. The rate of biomass production was retarded early in the incubation period in media initially at pH 3 or 4 as compared to pH 5, but the amount of growth was about the same in media containing the test sugars after 20 days. Large numbers of ascospores were produced between 8 and 10 days in media containing 5% sugar initially at pH 5 and 4. Production of ascospores was retarded at pH 3 in media containing 5% sugar as compared to media initially at pH 5 and 4.

Two hundred and eighty one soil samples from different provinces of Kenya were examined for dermatophytes by the hair baiting technique. Dermatophytes were recovered from 84 samples. Microsporum gypseum constituted 75.8% of the total isolates while Keratinomyces ajelloi and M. cookei formed 21% and 3.2%, respectively. The distribution of the dermatophytes was influences by soil pH, being more prevalent in acidic than in alkaline soils.

Mycological analyses were made on specimens obtained from the skin, oral rinse, urine, and feces of three subjects participating in a 56 day Skylab simulation test. Samples were taken over a 175 day period divided into three phases consisting of a prechamber, intrachamber, and postchamber period. A total of 69 species of filamentous fungi and 22 species of yeast and yeast-like fungi were recovered and identified. There was a marked decrease in the isolation incidence of both the filamentous and yeast and yeast-like fungi during the intrachamber period. This, taken with the fact that 71% of the filamentous species and 55% of the yeast and yeast-like species were isolated no more than twice, reflects the transitory nature of the relationship between the human body and most fungi. However, there was a relative increase in the potential pathogens Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis during the intrachamber period. Over 50% of all fungi recovered were isolated from the nasal and oral cavities. There was no evidence of intercrew transfer of a particular species during the intrachamber period nor was there any evidence of microbial shock during the postchamber period.

A significant tumor damaging effect (growth inhibition) on transplanted syngeneic sarcoma in mouse was obtained by means of pH-dependent activation of a transport form of a cancerostatic drug by an enzyme foreign to the organism. This effect was achieved by combined administration of 8-0-(alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl)beta-peltatin-A as a transport form of beta-peltatin-A and the exogenous enzyme alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Aspergillus niger and additional increase of the acidity of the tumor by injection of glucose. The combined application of the transport form plus enzyme showed a more favorable effect on selectivity than free peltatin when a quantitative comparison was made between the tumor growth inhibition and the damage to the blood picture.

In the last twenty years, the study of long-acting neuroleptic drugs has been active and promising progress in maintenance of psychotic patients. At present, there are several long-acting derivatives of phenothiazines, e.g. thioridazine, or drugs that allow the esterification of phenothiazine, e.g. perphenazine, fluphenazine and pipothiazine. Other esterifiable product is flupenthizol, which is a thioxanthene, and other long-acting drug is chlofluperol, which is a butyrophenone derivative. There is also a new series of neuroleptics, diphenilbultilpiperidine derivatives, such as fluspirilene, pimocide and penfluridol. Our clinical studies with these drugs allows us to state that there is a new revolution in pharmacological psychiatry, with important perspectives in the ways of helping patients.

48 patients with several types of seizures (following the international classification of epileptic seizures), were studied. Dipotassium chlorazepate was administered as a secondary antiepileptic drug. The cases were selected due to the severity of their seizures. The therapeutic results were evaluated with a daily record of seizures and attempt was made to correlate the serum levels of nordiazepam with the clinical results.

Motor disturbances of the oesophagus are attributable to hypermotility or hypomotility, or to peristaltic uncoordination of the upper or lower sphincter, or of the corpus. Endoesophageal manometry has enabled considerable progress to be made in the study of oesophageal dysfunction by allowing the spasm to be quantified. Treatment is poorly effective and its results are uncertain, save in the very few cases where surgery leads to resolution. For this reason, the efficacy of a new drug with marked antispastic properties, prifinium bromide, was investigated in 12 cases of megaoesophagus, of hiatal hernia, 6 of diverticulum, and 4 of dyskinesia in the light of the manometric values observed before and after its administration. The drug relieved spasm of the sphincters and corpus.

The effect of the thymus cells of the C57BL/6 mice on the colony forming ability of the stem hemopoietic cells of the embryonic liver and bone marrow of young (3 months) and old (2 years) mice was studied their joint transplantation into the mice (CBAXXC57BL/6) F1. The stimulating effect of the thymus cells on the colony forming ability of the stem hemopoietic cells of different age depends both on the dose of the stem hemopoietic cells of embryonic liver and the dose of T-lymphocytes. A suggestion is put forward that the stimulating effect of the thymus cells on the colony formation is due to their interaction with the stem cells in the G2 phase of the mitotic cycle.

The direction of differentiation of the stem cells with respect to the physiological activity of thymus determined by the age of an animal was studied by means of histological analysis of hemopoietic colonies in the spleen of lethally irradiated mice. The immaturity of thymus of its involution are characterized by the inhibition of differentiation of the stem cell along the granuloid path. An analysis of the data on differentiation of the stem cells in mice of different age, as well as in thymectomized mice allows to draw a conclusion that the process of differentiation of the hemopoietic stem cells is thymus-dependent.

Takayasu arteritis with renal artery involvement was the cause of severe persistent hypertension in eight children under 12 years of age. Features of severe hypertension dominated the clinical picture. Unequal or absent pulses were found in three patients. An irregular contour of the descending thoracic aorta on the chest roentgenogram was an early clue to the diagnosis. On aortography both renal arteries were affected in five patients, although a discrepancy in kidney size on excretory urography had suggested a unilateral lesion. Total aortography is mandatory to outline the full extent of the vascular abnormalities. All the patients had strongly positive tuberculin skin tests, and, although mycobacteria were not isolated, all patients received antituberculous as well as antihypertensive therapy. Nephrectomy of the worse kidney is contraindicated if the renal arteries are asymmetrically involved, for fear of later extension of the arteritis. Takayasu arteritis is an important cause of severe persistent hypertension in nonwhite children.

A study was made of the isotonic response of bovine mesenteric lymphatics to several physiological vasoactive substances. Contractions of lymphatic smooth muscles were induced by serotonin (5-HT), prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha), noradrenaline (NA), histamine, dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh). The smooth muscles were particularly sensitive to 5-HT. Excepting PGF2alpha no other substances could equal 5-HT in the magnitude of the maximum response. The majority of 5-HT receptors seemed to be the D receptors. The decreasing order of the contractile responses was as follows: 5-HT greater than PGF2alpha greater than NA greater than histamine greater than dopamine greater than ACh. The contractile response to ACh was observed only in specimens involving valvular region. It was very likely that, in the lymphatics, there were 2 kinds of receptors for catecholamines, i.e. alpha and beta receptors, and the stimulation of the former induced smooth muscle contraction and that of the latter relaxation. A difference was noticed between the responses of valvular and intervalvular segments to NA. Relaxations of lymphatic smooth muscles were induced not only by isoproterenol but also by adenosine and adenine nucleotides. The decreasing order of the relaxant responses was as follows: ISP greater than adenosine greater than ATP greater than ADP greater cyclic AMP greater than or equal to AMP. The relaxant responses to adenine nucleotides tended to reduce with decrease in the number of high energy phosphates.

1. The high oxygen affinity of fetal blood in rabbits is due to a very low concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in the red cells. In order to gather informations on the factors responsible for this characteristic we have studied synthesis and break-down of 2,3-DPG in fetal and adult rabbit red cells in vitro and examined possible regulative pathways which may lead to the low 2,3-DPG concentration in vivo. 2. Under conditions where 2,3-DPG and 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) accumulate in adult erythrocytes, i.e. in a solution containing inosine, pyruvate and inorganic phosphate, the amount of 2,3-DPG synthetized in fetal red cells was only 40% of the adult value and 3-PGA was not measurable. Upon inhibition of enolase by NaF, however, both 2,3-DPG and 3-PGA increased to a similar extent in fetal and adult red cells. These findings point towards differences in the pyruvate kinase (PK) reaction which is one of the rate limiting steps of glycolysis. Direct measurements revealed an over tenfold higher PK activity in fetal compared to adult red cells. This higher activity of PK will lead to a decreased concentration of 3-PGA with a consecutive fall in 2,3-DPG concentration. 3. Other factors, like a decreased glucose utilization, a decreased activity of 2,3-DPG mutase or an increased 2,3-DPG phosphatase activity could be excluded as a cause for the low 2,3-DPG concentration in fetal red blood cells. The same holds for extraerythrocytic factors like glucose concentration or pH value in fetal blood. 4. During the postnatal development of rabbits the PK activity decreased. 50 days after birth, PK activity was 20% of the fetal value but still somewhat higher than in adult erythrocytes. This change is paralleled by an increase in 2,3-DPG concentration and half saturation oxygen pressure. With respect to the synthesis of 2,3-DPG and ATP, the fetal rabbit red cell is comparable to hereditary high PK activity in human erythrocytes.

The mathematical model of the respiratory control system in man of Middendorf and Loeschcke (1976 a, b) opens the possibility to stimulate the constellation of parameters in non-respiratory acidosis. Several investigators agree that the pH in CSF or in the extracellular fluid of the brain stays remarkably constant in this situation and it can be shown that this is a result of a precise control rather than the consequence of a sluggishly reacting system. Application of the model assuming constant extracellular brain pH allowed to calculate the relative sensitivities to pH changes of the central and the peripheral sensory mechanisms generating respiratory drive. Assuming air breathing and a normal critical arterial O2-pressure and otherwise normal parameters of respiration, circulation and blood composition (except diminished buffer base) the central chemosensitivity to a pH change turned out to be 25 times the peripheral. This factor is critically dependent on the ratio of the bicarbonate change in extracellular brain fluid to that in arterial blood. The coinciding data of Fencl (1971) and of Kronenberg and Cain (1968) were used for the calculation.

Two DNA-dependent DNA-polymerases (E.C. 2.7.7.7) are partially purified from the high speed supernatant of mechanically disrupted hyphae of Neurospora crassa WT 74A. Some properties such as temperature and pH optimum and theoptimal concentrations for Mg2+, Zn2+, NH4+ and Na+ are very similar. On the other hand these enzymes show different properties on ion-exchange columns, are well distinguished by molecular weight (147 000 d and 110 000 d for A and B resp.) and the stimulation by K+ differs (K+ optimum for A: 5-70 mM and for B: 45 mM). Mn2+ and Zn2+ inhibit incorporation of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates between 70 and 90%. Our best preparations so far have specific activities of 13 200 units/mg protein for A and 12 000 units/mg protein for B.

A series of autopsy studies is presented of 13 cases of obliterative vascular disease of the vasa nervorum in a wide range of conditions, including polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, polymyositis and rheumatoid arthritis. In most cases, including 1 of rheumatoid neuropathy, the lesions were of the necrotising type. This supports the concept of polyarteritis nodosa as a pattern of reaction common to several diseases rather than that of a specific nosological entity. The remaining 4 cases of rheumatoid neuropathy, were associated with a bland endarteritis known as Bywater's arteritis. A comparison of these autopsy findings with clinical data and observations on sural nerve biopsies leads to the conclusion that all severe and most of the mild cases of rheumatoid neuropathy are due to occlusive vascular disease. Segmental demyelination independent of vascular lesions may be responsible for some of the mild cases and is frequently found in patients without clinical neurological manifestations.

Angiotensin II is known to undergo a reversible conformational transition and a change in potency in rat uterus in vitro with pK approximately 6.5. We have shown by carbon-13 NMR that the conformational transition involves all-trans to partly cis isomerization of the His6-Pro7 peptide bond. Isomerization from all-trans at pH 6.8 to approximately 16% cis at pH 8.0 is therefore correlated with a 10-fold increase in biological activity for [Asp1,Ile5]-angiotensin II in rat uterus in vitro. Isomerization from all-trans at pH 6.8 to approximately 16% cis at pH 8.0 in the competitive inhibitor [Phe4,Tyr8]angiotensin II is correlated with exhibition of virtually no agonist activity at low pH to full agonist activity at high pH. An angiotensin II conformation with Pro7 in the cis form may therefore be the conformation with maximal binding or biological activity at the cellular receptor.

ATP-driven transport and accumulation of epinephrine in chromaffin granule membrane vesicles isolated from bovine adrenal medulla is inhibited by the proton ionophores carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and nigericin, but not by valinomycin. Moreover, an artificially imposed pH gradient (interior acid) is able to drive this reserpine-sensitive transport system in the absence of ATP. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inactivator of the chromaffin granule membrane-bound ATPase, completely inhibits ATP-dependent epinephrine accumulation, but has much less effect when an imposed pH gradient is the driving force for epinephrine transport. The findings provide a strong indication that a pH gradient (interior acid) is the immediate driving force for epinephrine uptake in these storage granules and suggest that ATP-driven epinephrine transport is the result of two processes: (i) generation of a proton electrochemical gradient (interior acid and positive) by the membrane-bound, proton-translocating ATPase; and (ii) pH gradient-driven accumulation of the catecholamine.

Glucocerebrosidase was purified 26,000-fold from spleens from normal humans and from patients with Gaucher disease (Gaucher spleens). The specific activities of the purified normal and mutant enzymes with glucocerebroside as substrate were 8.5 X 10(5) and 5.4 X 10(4) nmol/mg of protein per hr, respectively. The ratio of enzymatic activities was constant throughout the isolation procedure. The two enzymes appeared to be similar by other parameters such as substrate affinity, heat lability, and pH optimum. Immunotitration with glucocerebrosidase antiserum showed equivalent quantities of crossreacting material in extracts of normal and Gaucher spleens. These data strongly suggest that the genetic basis of Gaucher disease is a strucutral mutation of glucocerebrosidase. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophporesis also indicate that there are differences between the normal and the Gaucher disease enzyme.

The ability of several neuroleptics to potentiate the inhibitory action of IP administered GABA on the motor activity of mice has been investigated. Haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, and clozapine, but not the apparently selective dopamine receptor-blocking agent spiperone, were found to possess such activity. Phenoxybenzamine also proved active in potentiating GABA. Thus blockade of dopamine receptors as well as alpha-adrenergic receptors may be responsible for neuroleptic-induced potentiation of GABA actions.

A putative neurotransmitter, 2-phenylethylamine, which is most highly concentrated in the extrapyramidal system of human brain, is able to reverse reserpine-induced parkinsonism in animals and elicit stereotypy. This action is only partially antagonized after catecholamine depletion by pretreatment with a-methyl-para-tyrosine, and fully blocked by pretreatment with haloperidol, a dopamine receptor blocker. Therefore, via direct and/or indirect actions, 2-phenylethylamine may serve a neuroregulatory role in the extrapyramidal system.

Kinetic parameters of morphine and azidomorphine derivatives as well as methionine enkephalin methylester were determined on the electrically stimulated isolated medial smooth muscle of the cat nictitating membrane. The organ was found to be a promising in vitro model for testing the action of opiate agonists on opiate B receptors.

The rate constant for the hydrolysis of prostacyclin (PGI2) to 6-keto-PGF1alpha was measured by monitoring the UV spectral change, over a pH range 6 to 10 at 25 degrees C and the total ionic strength of 0.5 M. The first-order rate constant (kdegreesobs) extrapolated to zero buffer concentration follows an expression, kdegreesobs = kH+ (H+), where kH+ is a second-order rate constant for the specific acid catalyzed hydrolysis. The value of kH+ obtained (3.71 x 10(4) sec-1 M-1) Is estimated approximately 700-fold greater than a kH+ value expected from the hydrolysis of other vinyl ethers. Such an unusually high reactivity of PGI2 even for a vinyl ether is attributed to a possible ring strain release that would occur upon the rate controlling protonation of C5. A Brønsted slope (alpha) of 0.71 was obtained for the acid (including H3O+) catalytic constants, from which a pH independent first-order rate constant for the spontaneous hydrolysis (catalyzed by H2O as a general acid) was estimated to be 1.3 x 10(-6) sec-1. An apparent activation energy (Ea) of 11.85 Kcal/mole was obtained for the hydrolysis at pH 7.48, from which a half-life of PGI2 at 4 degrees C was estimated to be approximately 14.5 min. when the total phosphate concentration is 0.165 M (cf. 3.5 min. at 25 degrees C).

Mouse thymus cells possess a B2-adrenergic receptor and, when centrifuged through a solution of propanolol at 5 degrees and washed three times, will produce reduced amounts of cyclic AMP during a 5 minute challenge with isoproterenol at room temperature. Depending on the concentration and nature of the antagonist, the retained inhibition may be greater or less than that seen when it is added with the agonist. This retained inhibition is readily reversed at 37 degrees even in the absence of the agonist. These effects can also be demonstrated with rat erythrocytes and with their subsequently prepared ghosts making it most likely that they result from the specific and tight binding of the antagonist to the beta receptor.

The in vitro effect of ten benzodiazepine derivatives on the cholinesterases of human plasma and red cells was determined. Flurazepam, temazepam, lorazepam, flunitrazepam and diazepam had an inhibitory effect on plasma cholinesterase of 60--90 per cent and, with the exception of lorazepam, an inhibitory effect of 40--50 per cent on red cell cholinesterase. Clonazepam, oxazepam, chlordiazepoxide, nitrazepam and bromazepam had comparatively minor effects on both enzymes

The writers present some physiological (and not therapeutic) acute and sub-acute trials with tripeptide: L-propyl-L-leucyl-glycine amide (M.I.F.-I) in Parkinson's Disease. This work confirms the earlier observation that M.I.F.-I employed alone or in combination with Levodopa is active against Parkinson's disease. The writers evoke the hypothesis that this action takes place at the postsynaptic receptors, whose configuration may be modified in the sense of a hypersensitivity. These studies justify undertaking a series of controlled therapeutic trials when the cost of the product permits and as well instituting development work on analogues active orally.

Sexual behaviour and fertility of schizophrenic patients are discussed. The various sexual dysfunctions induced by neuroleptics, such as decrease in libido, troubles of ejaculation and impotence, are described and related to their various mechanisms of action. The central antidopaminergic effect of neuroleptics would be responsible for an overall non-specific decrease in libido. Their effect upon the autonomous nervous system would explain ejaculation disturbances. Their endocrine action (increase in prolactine) would produce impotence. The possibility of treatment of these endocrinological troubles by bromocriptine is discussed.

Cimetidine was studied in 8 cases of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The average dose was 1,2 g a day for 14 to 195 days. The treatment was remarkably effective in 2 cases, but only partial or temporary improvement was noted in 3 other cases. The last 3 patients failed to respond to treatment. The possibility of a rebound phenomenon requires strict clinical and biological supervision.

Hematologic investigations were carried out in 50 patients with various forms of epilepsy, aged 20 to 50 years, who had been treated for different periods of time with antiepileptic and neuroleptic drugs such as primidon, luminal and prasine. All the cytomorphological and cytochemical studies concerned the white blood cells, especially lymphocytes, and their transformation into plasma cells and histiomonocytes. The cytochemical investigations referred particularly to nucleolar-RNA, glycogen and lipid cellular content. The results obtained showed that the lymphocyte count and mostly that of the large and medium lymphocytes, may reach twice the normal or more. The transition forms towards histiomonocytes and plasma cells were quite frequent. Cytochemically, a variable state of reactivity of the nucleolar apparatus was demonstrated, as well as certain changes of the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The influence of such changes on the cellular and humoral immunity of the respective patients is discussed. Emphasis is also laid on the utility of such investigations for the detection of the untoward effects of antiepileptic and neuroleptic drugs on hematopoiesis.

Many small cell carcinomas share morphological and physiological characteristics with normal and neoplastic cells of Pearse's APUD series, including pulmonary APUD cells and pulmonary carcinoid tumors. There is very likely more than one type of APUD cell in the lung, and conclusions that small cell carcinomas and carcinoids reflect neoplastic transformation of the same cell type are probably premature. The embryoogic lineage of pulmonary APUD cells is at present uncertain. The hypothesis that all APUD cells are derived from the neural crest is no longer tenable, and although some evidence does suggest a neural contribution to the pulmonary epithelium, additional embryologic studies are required. Some tumors that currently are classified as small cell carcinomas probably do not have APUD cell characteristics, and still others appear to have both APUD and non-APUD features. A  subclassification of small cell carcinomas based on a combination of physiological and morphological features might prove to be of prognostic and therapeutic value, but current knowledge probably would not provide a sufficient foundation for a reliable or practical subclassification. Multidisciplinary studies of the differentiation and function of normal and neoplastic APUD cells in the lungs and elsewhere are needed.

The blood gas/acid-base status of normal healthy Black, Indian, Coloured and White pregnant women was measured. All groups exhibited evidence of hyperventilation (decreased) PaCO2 relative to the non-pregnant state, with compensatory metabolic adjustment. Arterial oxygen tensions (PaO2) were significantly lower in the Black and Indian groups compared with their White counterparts (P less than 0,01). Differences between the former two series and the Coloured group, however, just failed to reach statistically significant levels (0,1 less than P less than 0,05). The possible causes of a lowered PaO2 during pregnancy and their relevance to obstetric anaesthesia are discussed. A further study using a more sophisticated protocol is planned in an attempt to delineate the causes of these important differences.

A sodium citrate preparation (Citro-Soda; Abbott) given in single doses of 4 or 12 g, satisfactorily increased the pH level of urine without affecting the systemic acid-base balance. When the sodium citrate preparation was administered in the 12-g single dose the gastric pH level was raised above 3,0 in a significant number of subjects. Similar results were obtained with both single doses (4 and 12 g) after 3 - 6 days of continuous therapy at the appropriate dose given every 6 hours. It is concluded that the urine-alkalinizing sodium citrate preparation reduced intragastric acidity significantly.

A diagnostic dip-stick for measuring pseudocholinesterase activity has been assessed by 4 participants and compared with a standard spectrophotometric method. Duplicate dip-stick estimations (measured in kU/l) corresponded closely, and concurrence between participants was good. The dip-stick estimate of cholinesterase was consistently lower than the spectrophotometric value; the magnitude of this deviation depended on the absolute enzyme activity. With enzyme activities of up to 1 kU/l the dip-stick value was 1 unit lower. Between 1 and 4 kU/l the dip-stick estimate compared well with the spectrophotometric value. From 5 to 7 kU/l and beyond 7 kU/l the negative deviation recorded by the dip-stick increased to 2 units or more. Normal enzyme activity is 3 - 6 kU/l. Over the 1 - 4 kU/l range the method is most accurate, thus negative deviation below 1 kU/l or above 4 kU/l is generally diagnostically irrelevant. On the basis of cost, convenience, speed and accuracy this method will suffice in the absence of sophisticated assay facilities.

The pharmacology of the beta-adrenergic antagonists, particularly their role as competitive antagonists at the receptor site, is discussed. The clinical use of these agents is listed and a detailed outline of their use in angina pectoris, hypertension and conditions associated with increased sympathetic activity is provided. The relative contraindications to the use of beta-adrenergic antagonists are summarized and the pharmacology of those drug interactions involving these agents is discussed. A thorough understanding of the pharmacology and therapeutics of these agents, which interfere with physiological function, is mandatory prior to their clinical use.

Win 18,446, a bis(dichloroacetyl)diamine, is a drug that was previously shown to suppress spermatogenesis and to be an effective oral abortifacient in rats. The present study shows that the drug is capable of producing characteristic congenital malformations in high incidence, by a single treatment, and with high survival of fetuses to day 21. Gestation day 11 is the most sensitive time. The teratologies obtained after various schedules of treatment include malformations of the snout (100%), septal heart defects (100%) diaphragmatic hernias (100%), cryptorchism (100%), cervical pockets (100%) and absent or small irregular thymus (92%). Some of these data, namely of the  heart, face and thymus, cluster in patterns that indicate that the action of the drug is upon a time-resistricted developmental process. These periods of sensitivity are subsiding or have ended before primordia of these structures appear, but they coincide with the proliferation and migration of those mesenchyme cells that will eventually form or contribute to the structures affected. It is postulated that the drug acts on these mesenchyme cells, or on the extracellular matrix that provides the necessary framework for their dispersal.

It is now obvious that there are a number of factors which can influence the stability of interferons. Since human fibroblast interferon is especially unstable both to heat and mechanical stress, the use of stabilizing conditions such as low pH or thioctic acid should facilitate purification and concentration of this interferon. Leukocyte interferon, on the other hand, seems to be more stable even when highly purified; however, losses in activity can occur in very dilute solutions containing low concentrations of protein. Inactivation during storage of interferons may be avoided by using freeze-dried preparations. In order to generate large quantities of purified, stable interferons for clinical use, there is a need to establish an armamentarium of different nontoxic techniques and approaches that will enable investigators to stabilize human interferons at each step in preparation, processing, concentration, purification, shipment and storage.

When a slice of calcium bilirubinate stone was incubated in a solution of tetrasodium salt of ethylendiamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA.4Na), a potent chelating agent, the solution exhibited a yellow brown tint, which was spectroscopically characteristic of bilirubin. Microscopic examination of the slice revealed dissolution of granules of calcium bilirubinate, leaving behind a reticular matrix of PAS-positive substance. The effect of EDTA.4Na was influenced by pH, being fully effective only at pH 10 or more, and by temperature and concentration as well. Simultaneous application of bile salt enhanced the activity of EDTA.4Na, hydrophilizing the gallstone surface to facilitate chelating reaction and also dissolving minor fatty components of the stone. Heparin at proper concentrations also promoted disintegration of the stone, changing surface potential of its constituent particles to the dispersion-prone charge. The effect of composite EDTA.4Na-bile salt-heparin was thus significantly greater than that of single EDTA.4Na. This mixture is promising for clinical application as a means of direct dissolution of residual gallstones.

By means of two-wave-length visible cytophotometry, the content of acidic and basic proteins per cell nucleus was shown to increase in CA3 hippocampal neurons only 3 hours after the learning session of conditioned reflex of passive avoidance. The protein content in the nuclei of perineuronal neuroglia cells of CA3 hippocampus increased only 6 hours after the learning session. Biochemical mechanisms dealing with the process of learning are discussed.

The effect of ionic strength and pH on the release of some enzymes of the matrix of peroxisomes in rat's liver was studied. Catalase, L ALpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase were easily released from the particles during their lysis and treatment with 0.16 M KCl, whereas urate oxidase, NADH cytochrome c reductase and D-amino acid oxidase were not solubilized. After the solubilization of peroxisomal membrane by 0.2% Triton X-100, the remaining core contained about 50% amino acid oxidase activity, and had 1.28--1.30 g/cm3 density. These results suggest that D-amino acid oxidase associates with urate oxidase in the peroxisomal core.

The results of the investigation of main indices of acid-base equilibrium in 28 patients with acute obstruction of the mesenteric vessels are set forth. 12 patients out of 28 developed subcompensated or decompensated metabolic acidosis. The authors believe that the correction of acid-base equilibrium disorders is an efficacious factor of intense therapy and recommend to use it at all the stages of the treatment.

1. Dogs absorbed [14C]nadolol almost completely (88--104%) after oral administration of 10--75 mg/kg. In contrast, mice, rats, hamsters, and rabbits, given oral doses of 20 mg/kg, absorbed, at most, 25%. After administration of oral doses of 2--75 mg/kg, monkeys absorbed no more than an average of 30%. Six monkeys given oral doses of 10 mg/kg absorbed 12--44%. 2. In rats, [14C]nadolol was orally absorbed to an average of 13.7--17.5%, whether given in suspension or in solution, indicating that absorption was not limited by rate of dissolution nor by solubility. 3. Mildly hypertensive humans given single doses of [14C]nadolol (2 or 80 mg, orally) and normal subjects given single doses (10 mg, orally) absorbed an average of 20.4--33.3%.

The possible involvement of the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway in ammonia assimilation is reported in a monokaryon of Coprinus cinereus.

The microbial biodegradation of cellophane (U.C.B.--Division Sidac) was studied. Preliminary experiments with pure cultures of seven cellulolytic microorganisms (Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., Chaetomium crispatum, Ch. globosum, Sclerotium rolfsii and two actinomycetes) revealed that the substrate as such was very recalcitrant, probably due to the occurrence of insoluble coating agents. Therefore, mixed cultures of the above mentioned cellulolytic microorganisms were used as inoculum. The cellophane showed a slow microbial degradation which starts only after 37 days of incubation. This long lag-phase is due to the unaltered presence of the coating agents. However, when the coating agents are extracted with tetrahydrofuran, the biodegradation starts after 10 days, resulting in a biodegradation rate of 85% after 52 days of incubation and a protein content of 30%. The endproduct (30% protein, 60% soluble sugars, 10% residual substrate) will probably be useful as compost.

The kinetics of nitrosation of dimethylamine (DMA) in aqueous perchloric acid solution have been studied using a differential spectrophotometric technique. The rate law is Initial rate = e[DMA]0 [nitrite]2 0 [H+]/(f + [H+])2 where [DMA]0 and [nitrite]0 represent initial stoichiometric concentrations. At 310.0 K and mu = 2.0 M, e = (2.2 +/- 0.2) X 10(-5) M-1 s-1 and f = (1.28 +/- 0.02) X 10(-3) M. The associated activation energy is 56 +/- 3 kJ mol-1. A clear inhibition of the nitrosation rate by ionic strength has been observed in which only the kinetic parameter (f) has an effective change. It is concluded that under the experimental conditions of this work only the dinitrogen trioxid is the effective carrier for the nitrosation.

Aconitase and NAD linked isocitrate dehydrogenase were present in Ascaris lumbricoides muscle at only very low activities, whilst there were significant levels of citrate synthase, NADP linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinic thiokinase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase was present in A. lumbricoides muscle at levels comparable with mammalian tissues and results suggest that it is modulated via a phosphotransferase/phosphatase system. The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, citrate, isocitrate and 2-oxoglutarate were all detected in freeze clamped muscle, but their steady state levels were considerably lower than those found in mammalian tissues.

Laboratory studies were undertaken to evaluate the role of environmental factors on the development of free-living stages of the cat hookworm Ancylostoma tubaeforme. An index of development calculated from the proportion of eggs that developed to the infective stage and the reciprocal of the development period, has suggested that the absence of 'high' temperatures (26 degrees - 30 degrees C) would significantly affect the L3 population in contaminated soils. There were, however, no significant differences in the size and lipid content of L3 that had developed at the different temperatures.

Impressions of a congress-visiting-journey through the highly-industrialized far-east Japan are the background for description of specific Japanese Psychotherapeutic-technics f.i.: the Morita-therapy, Naikan-therapy and the Fasten-therapy. To the analytically trained Psychosomatic-specialist of western mentality those medical applications appear rather bewildering if not frightening. Their psychodynamic and their effectiveness become more understandable regarding the social-cultural conditions in modern Japan founded and grown on a tradition thousands of years old. Psychoanalysis can't prosper there. During the congress of the ICPM (International College of Psychosomatic Medicine) in Kyoto it became evident to the author by visits to clinics and above all by experience of typical Japanese travelling impressions, how much just psychotherapy and it's special drive-dynamical intentions are to a major degree depending on social-cultural development, the norms of value, the religion and the philosophy of a society.--Nippon is unique--strange and fascinating.

The effect of urea additions on the microbiological and chemical properties of silage, produced from young maize plants (Darawa stage), was studied. Urea treatments, i.e., 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1.00%, stimulated higher densities of the desired microorganisms than the control, while undesired organisms showed lower counts (proteolytic and saccharolytic anaerobes). Addition of 0.25 to 0.50% or urea resulted in the production of high quality silage with pleasant small and high nutritive value, as confirmed by the various microbiological and chemical analyses conducted. Higher levels (0.75 and 1.00%) of urea decreased the quality of the product.

Trichophyton rubrum strains freshly isolated from clinical material exhibited red pigment formation within 7 days at 26 degrees C on slant serum-albumin agar, initial pH 7.0. In Trichophyton mentagrophytes strains this phenomenon could not be observed. Since in the case of T. rubrum, yellow pigmentation will appear at an initial pH of 5.0, the use of initial pH values of 7.0 and 5.0 is recommended for diagnostic application of slant serum-albumin agar.

The clinical picture of myocardial infarctions in complicated and manifold. A clinico-physiological analysis of neurological disorders gives ground to consider that in myocardial infarctions the process of irritation involves the peripheral vegetative apparatus and spinal segmental structures, as well as the hypothalmostem structures with the reticular formation, which in its turn is accompanied by disturbances of cortico-subcortical interrelationships. In patients with myocardial infarctions the vegetative disorders are of a regional character and may be expressed in symptomatology, characteristic of the stimulation of sympathetic ganglions on the left side, mainly in the stellate node.

Cathepsin B and collagenolytic cathepsin were obtained from bovine spleen and human placenta and identified as thiol proteinases. Both enzymes degraded insoluble fibrous collagen maximally at pH 3.5 and soluble monomeric collagen near pH 4.5. The response to activators and inhibitors was similar for both enzymes. Collagenolytic cathepsin was unable to degrade the synthetic substrates of cathepsin B and was also shown to differ in its physico-chemical properties. Minor differences were noted in the action of these cathepsins on insoluble fibrous collagen from different tissues. It was concluded that the rate and extent of the dissolution of fibrous collagen was determined by the number and location of the interchain cross-links, the amount of the associated non-collagenous components and the type of solvent ions, but not by the collagen phenotype.

Plasma testosterone has been studied in 31 full-term male infants born with bilaterally undescended testes (14) or unilaterally undescended testis (17). From 10 to 89 days after birth, the post-natal testosterone rise was significantly lower in the 18 infants who remained cryptorchid at 4 months than in the 13 who underwent spontaneous testicular descensus and in the normal controls. Blunted post-natal Leydig cell secretion in cryptorchids may relate to a primary LH defect and could contribute to the impairment of both testicular descensus and maturation.

Young adult (3 months old) and old (26-28 months old) male Wistar rats were studied. Testicular weight was 1.66 g (range: 1.33--2.86) in the younger group and 1.62 g (range: 1.04--1.90) in the older group. The total Leydig cell volume as measured by a quantitative histometric method was significantly larger in the old animals (-x = 0.153 ml vs. -x = 0.089 ml). The testicular HCG binding capacity was 2.54 ng HCG per 100 mg tissue (range: 1.88--3.77) in the younger animals and 1.83 ng HCG per 100 mg tissue (range: 0.80--3.02) in the older ones (P less than 0.01). Plasma testosterone was on an average 242 ng/100 ml (range: 72--1162) in the young adult rats and 91 ng/100 ml (range: 23--277) in the older rats. Plasma LH was only slightly  (P less than 0.05) decreased and was 49 ng LH-RP-1/ml (range: 14--120) in the younger group and 40 ng LH-RP-1 ng/ml (range: 5--98) in the older. When the testicular tissue pieces were incubated with different doses of HCG or dibutyryl cAMP and testosterone production was measured, identical dose-response curves for old and young tissue were obtained. After in vitro incubation with a NADPH generating system, which under the conditions used was a much stronger stimulus for steroid biosynthesis than HCG or dibutyryl cAMP, the tissue of young rats produced about twice the amount of testosterone precursors (pregnenolone, progesterone, 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione) than old tissue.

The influence of a sedative dose of "lytic cocktail" (chlorpromazine, promethazine and pethidine) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen consumjtion (CMRO2) was tested in artificially ventilated rats, maintained on either 70% N2 or 70% N2O. When given alone, the lytic cocktail had no significant effect on CBF or CMRO2. However, in the presence of nitrous oxide there was a 25% reduction in blood flow and oxygen consumption.

Transcutaneous PCO2 electrodes habe been constructed and evaluated on adults and children. Glass pH and silver reference electrodes were used at 44--45 degrees C, with either circulating water and a copper jacket, or with internal electrical heating. The skin surface PCO2 at 44 degrees C is about 1.33 times PaCO2 plus 3 mmHg when measured with electrodes calibrated in gas at 44 degrees C. Three temperature effects combine in this ratio: Heating raises blood PCO2 4.5%/degrees C, skin metabolism adds about 3 mmHg, and the cooling of the electrode active surface by skin increases electrode reading. Response time to step changes of PaCO2 was about 3 min to 63%, of which 1.2 min was sensor delay, the remainder skin CO2 washout. It was found important to use ethylene glycol-water mixtures rather than water for electrolyte to avoid bubble generation and drift. Heat transfer through the pH glass electrode has been increased by enlarging the internal silver electrode to virtually fill the entire glass electrode. Time required for initial vasodilation and stabilization is similar to that of tcPO2 electrodes, and accuracy of determination of PaCO2 appears to be better than +/- mmHg.

Two cases of low impedance, non-glass membrane electrodes for pH measurement were evaluated: (I) Metal--metal oxide electrodes and (II) Reduction-oxidation electrodes. The fundamental cause of oxygen sensitivity of metal-metal oxide electrodes were examined and three approaches for its suppression were proposed. For the case of Sb--Sb2Ox electordes, oxygen sensitivity can be attenuated partially by cell loading, either directly across the reference electrode or indirectly across a third slave electrode. In a PO2 range of 8--54 kPa, more than 95% of the PO2  response can be suppressed by loading the cell emf to half of tis open-circuit value. The oxygen sensitivity also was observed to diminished by grinding the metal-metal oxide and pressing it under high pressure into a pellet electrode. Other metal-metal oxide electrodes that have promise in transcutaneous  measurement are the Pd-PdO2 electrodes. The redox electrodes are typified by the Quinhydrone electrode. A membrane Quinhydrome electrode showed a sensitivity of 56 mV/Decade at 37 degree C and no oxygen sensitivity up to 50 kPa and a drift of 1 mV/h over a 24-h period. However, the stability deteriorated over a long-term period.

Infusion of isoproterenol (1 microgram/kg/min, i.v.) into the anesthetized pregnant rhesus monkey near term consistently reduced fetal oxygenation, despite diminishing myometrial activity. The decline in pO2 of fetal arterial blood (mean = 4.3 +/- 2.3 mmHg S.D.) was accompanied by an increase in pCO2 tension (mean = 4.6 +/- 2.7 mmHg) and a decline in pH (mean = 0.04 +/- 0.02 S.D.). There was an increase in heart rate and a widening of pulse pressure in the mother and also in the adequately oxygenated fetus providing evidence that the agent crosses the placenta. The poorly oxygenated fetuses developed bradycardia and hypotension. Administration of isoproterenol directly to the fetus elicited similar changes in the composition of blood, and in blood pressure and heart rate, to those observed after administration of the agent to the mother.

Thirty-two eyes from 19 patients with either capsular glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma or primary open angle glaucoma were given topical timolol and followed through a 3--6 months period. Twelve eyes were previously out of control on full medication including pilocarpine, epinephrine and acetazolamide. Eight of these eyes could be adequately controlled throughout the follow-up period on topical timolol or a combination of timolol and pilocarpine, but without resorting to acetazolamide. One eye needed acetazolamide in combination with timolol, and three eyes had to be referred to surgery. Twelve eyes were adequately controlled either on pilocarpine or full medication, but could be equally well controlled on timolol alone, or timolol and pilocarpine in combination. Acetazolamide could be withheld from all of the six patients who used this drug. Eight eyes were previously untreated. They could all be adequately controlled either on timolol (5 eyes) or timolol and pilocarpine (3 eyes). The study indicates that the effect of timolol 0.5% X 2 may be stronger than the combined effect of epinephrine 1% X 2 and acetazolamide 500 mg a day. Topical timolol was well tolerated. No side reactions occurred and the pupillary size and reactions were not influenced by the timolol treatment.

The kinetics of the antibacterial actions of cephalexin and cephaloridin against a strain of Escherichia coli and a strain of Staphylococcus aureus were studied by a flow microcalorimeter. The heat production was related to the number of viable organisms (CFU ml-1), the pH, the optical density of the culture medium (OD540), and the morphology of the antibiotic-exposed bacteria. No heat effects could be registered when the number of CFU was below 10(4) ml-1. The addition of cephalexin, 2.5 microgram ml-1 (5 x MIC), to cultures of S. aureus caused a decrease in the heat production which was only roughly correlated with the number of CFU ml-1. This was also the case when 9.0 microgram ml-1 (2 x MIC) of this drug were added to cultures of E. coli. Two to three hours after the drugs had been added, no heat effects could be registered for the following 6--8 hours, after which an increase in the heat production again occurred. The MIC and MBC of the organisms isolated during this late heat increase were 8--40 times higher than those of the parent test organisms. A direct relation between drug concentration and response, i.e. heat effects produced, was found when increasing concentrations of cephalexin, i.e. 1.0 up to 50 micrograms ml-1 (2--100 x MIC) were added in the logarithmic growth phase to cultures of S. aureus. In ampoule calorimetric experiments, E. coli was cultured in a non-aerated, sealed growth vessel in the presence of cephalexin or cephaloridin in concentrations corresponding to 1/2 x MIC. The thermograms did not differ in shape, although the heat effects occurred somewhat later in the culture containing cephaloridin.

Ca uptake by microsomes isolated from non-pregnant rabbit myometrium was potentiated by both inorganic phosphate (Pi) and oxalate anions. Both Pi and oxalate had little effect on the initial rate of uptake but a pronounced effect on the capacity of Ca uptake measured after 20 min which was greater in the presence of oxalate than that of Pi (5 mM each). The presence or absence of sucrose in the uptake medium had a significant effect on oxalate-induced potentiation of Ca uptake but not on that potentiated by Pi or that measured in the absence of either potentiating anion. A part of Ca accumulated additionally under the influence of sucrose could be removed by washing microsomes with KCl. Another significant difference between the pontentiating effect of oxalate and Pi was observed when the pH of the incubation medium was varied. In the presence of oxalate the pH optimum was between 6.4--6.8, whereas that in its absence or in the presence of Pi the optimal pH was around 7.2. Reduction in pH from 7.2 to 6.8 along with the substitution of KCl by sucrose resulted in 3-fold increase in Ca uptake when oxalate was used as the potentiating anion. The results suggest that Ca is taken up by a different mechanism in the presence of oxalate than that in its absence or when oxalate anion is substituted with inorganic phosphate.

The hypnotic effect of flunitrazepam (Ro 5-4200), nitrazepam and a placebo was studied in 117 outpatients using hypnotics for at least 3 months prior to the study. They obtained various neurotropic drugs and this and other treatments were unchanged throughout the trial period of 13 weeks. This consisted of 3 weeks on the previously used hypnotic, 3 weeks on a test drug (during the first of these a doubling of the dose was permitted if the initial dose of 1 mg flunitrazepam, 5 mg nitrazepam or one tablet of placebo was not satisfactory) and 4 weeks' observation after a request to stop medication with the test drug. The effects were evaluated every week by self-ratings. Also noted were: the frequency of dose increase after 1 week of the test period, number of drop-outs in the test period, and failure in the attempt to stop taking the test drug. A "psychological concentration test" was done, as was a follow-up interview. The self-ratings had a good reliability and showed that more patients experienced shorter sleep induction, longer sleep time, better sleep quality and a subjective feeling of having had a better rest with flunitrazepam than with either nitrazepam or placebo. There were no differences between the nitrazepam and the placebo groups. Tiredness was the most common side effect and appeared in the same frequency in all groups. The number of patients who increased the dose after 1 week's medication, as well as the number of drop-outs, was significantly higher in the nitrazepam and placebo groups than in the flunitrazepam group. There was no difference in the ability to discontinue the medication between the test groups or between groups having previously used different hypnotics. The "psychological concentration test" did not reveal any differences between groups. It was concluded that withdrawal of a hypnotic in chronic users was not facilitated by the use of a placebo. This was interpreted as due to a strong psychological dependence upon the hypnotics and their lack of pharmacological effects during long-term treatment.

The enzymatic conversion of azathioprine to 6-mercaptopurine was detected at pH 6.5 with rat liver supernatants, although the non-enzymatic reaction predominated at pH 7.0 and 7.5. Glutathione S-transferase may catalize this conversion. Activities of the enzyme in liver with both zathioprine and 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene as substrate decreased upon carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic injury. These results may explain an ineffectiveness of azathioprine in patients with severe hepatic damage.

The surgical denervation techniques have been widely employed as a tool to identify the neuronal origin of various neurotransmitters in the basal ganglia. Besides the well known nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, there is a high glutamic acid-containing corticostriatal connection and the cholinergic thalamostriatal projection. On the other hand, it is strongly suggested that GABA is the transmitter for the strionigral and striopallidal efferent systems. Furthermore, no evidence was found to support strionigral or striopallidal cholinergic pathways. From the 6-OHDA experiments, it is proposed that the 6-OHDA not only has a selective toxic effect on dopaminergic neurons, but also affects the cholinergic neurons in the striatum, and may provide further evidence for dopaminergic-cholinergic interaction in the striatum. Finally, GABA may modulate dopamine metabolism in the striatum.

The formation of ethanolamine plasmalogen from labelled 1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine was studied in neurons and glial cells of the developing rat brain. It was found that the conversion of the ether to the enol-ether bond of the 1-alkyl moiety by the neuronal and glial desaturase system requires unsaturated fatty acids at the 2 position of the substrate. There is almost no difference between the activity of the neuronal and glial desaturase during the period of active myelination, whereas the neuronal cell fraction of the adult rats displays a threefold higher enzyme activity as compared to the glial cells. Evidence for the involvement of a microsomal electron transport system in the enzymic conversion of alkylacyl-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine to ethanolamine plasmalogen was obtained by using specific antibodies against NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase. Cytochrome b5 stimulated the biosynthesis of ethanolamine plasmalogen.

The results of studies presented may be interpreted in light of the dual contribution theory of regulation of CSF acid-base balance, indicating significant interaction between systemic and local CNS mechanisms in H+ homeostasis in the brain and CSF. Both systemic and local mechanisms are at work in H+ homeostasis in the brain and CSF and depending on the specific acid-base disorder or the duration of the imbalance one or the other of the two factors may be the dominant one in maintaining H+ levels in the "normal" range. These factors come into play only when there has been a change in central pH with the primary aim of bringing the CNS [H+] towards normal.

Recombination and cross-reactivation between virulent influenza viruses and a cold-adapted thermosensitive vaccine strain regularly produced genetically stable attenuated recombinants, the selection of which was based on the thermosensitivity marker. This marker, correlating with the safety of the recombinants for man was inherited independently on the properties of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface antigens. There was no relationship between the thermosensitivity of the resulting recombinants and the decrease in the optimal temperature of the neuraminidase activity (OTNA marker). This indicates a separate localization in the viral genome of the mutation damages responsible for the expression of ts and OTNA markers.

Interactions of Getah and Sindbis virus populations in mixed infections of 5 tissue systems were competitive or neutral. The type of interaction is regulated by the host cell and virus population density. On reproduction in mouse brains and SPEV cell cultures the mixed population exhibited antigenic markers of Getah virus; in Syrian hamster kidney and chick embryo cell cultures those of Sindbis virus; and in Chinese hamster kidney cell cultures the antigenic markers of both viruses. Mixed populations with monospecific antigenic characteristics contained genomes of both viruses detectable by the TC marker (dual spetrum of cytopathogenicity). Clonal analysis of such populations confirmed the occurrence of genome masking and demonstrated the formation of genotypically mixed particles. Possible mechanisms of the antigenic dominance of one virus and selective blocking of functions of the other virus are discussed.

In rabbits inoculated into the right scarified cornea with the Kupka strain of human Herpesvirus type 1 (HHV 1), healing of the keratitis occurred between days 8--12 post infection (p.i.). Viral particles were seen in nuclei and cytoplasm of corneal epithelium cells and in a few fibrocytes of corneal stroma. By immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, the virus was demonstrated in single neurons and satellite cells of the homolateral Gasserian ganglion since 24 hr p.i. From 20 hr to 8 days p.i., HHV 1 was found in ganglia of 7 out of 15 rabbits, while the explantation was positive in 10 out of 12 animals. In the course of latency, single HHV antigen-containing cells were seen in ganglia of 3 out of 7 rabbits and virus isolation attempts before explantation always were negative. Viral antigen was found in single ganglion cells only in 20% of rabbits with healed corneal lesions while the explanation of the ganglion tissue yielded HHV at an unchanged high frequency (92% of animals).

Among 46 novel pyrimido [5.4-d] pyrimidine derivatives, 26 compounds were found to exhibit antiviral activity as revealed in a test programme against Mengo, Coxsackie B1, fowl plague, vaccinia and pseudorabies viruses, as concerns inhibition of plaque formation and of infectious virus yield. Attempts to disclose structure-activity relationships by discriminant analysis pointed to a possible importance of hydrophobic substitution for the antiviral effectiveness against Mengo virus of the derivatives investigated.

Mild acid hydrolysis of phase I Coxiella burnetii cells gradually cleaved off polysaccharide chains, which contain determinants of antigen 1, thus unmasking determinants of the diagnostically important antigen 2. This artificial phase I to phase II conversion was reflected by changed serological activity in the complement-fixation (CF) test and by changed nonspecific phagocytosis. The product of mild acid hydrolysis can serve as a complex diagnostic preparation, because it reacts in the CF test with antibodies directed to both C. burnetii antigens.

In the course of studies on influenza virus ecology, Influenzavirus A was isolated from a cloacal smear from a wild duck (Anas platyrhynchos) caught in west Slovakia. The strain was identified as A(Hav7Nav1). The results of virus isolation experiments from other species of aquatic and other small birds were negative.

Purified lipopolysaccharide-protein complex (LPS-PC) extracted by trichloroacetic acid from phase I Coxiella burnetii organisms induced in mice and rabbits fair levels of antibodies directed to antigen 1 and antigen 2, as detected by complement-fixation (CF), microagglutination (MA), opsonization-phagocytosis (OP) and serum protection (SP) tests. In guinea pigs only very low levels of MA antibodies against antigen 2 were demonstrated. In rabbit serum, MA antibodies directed to antigen 2 were found exclusively in the IgM fraction after the primary immunizing dose; the second dose was followed by gradual shift of MA antibodies to the IgG class. Two immunizing doses of the LPS-PC were more effective when testing antibody response in mice or protection of mice and guinea pigs against phase I virulent challenge.

Diagnostic and clinical experience gained in the period from 1966--1977 is summarized. Cytomegalovirus was isolated from 35 sucklings and 5 infants aged more than 1 year as well as from necropsy materials from 10 sucklings. The most frequently involved were the respiratory tract (77.8%), liver (53.5%) and haematopoetic apparatus (42.2%). Congenital defects were found in 22.2%. The incidence in the population varied from 20% in sucklings to 50--60% in persons aged over 40 years. The incidence of infection was higher in sucklings and infants in nurseries. Out of 37 adult patients with kidney transplantation, the virus was isolated from 10 (27%) and complement-fixing antibodies were found in 34 (91%) patients.

Slab polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of Influenza-virus A strains varying in antigenic composition of the envelope and in the natural host species showed the nucleprotein and membrane proteins to have a standard molecular weight of 58,000 and 24,000 daltons, respectively. The electrophoretic mobility and molecular weights of the light and heavy chains of haemagglutinin varied in the strains under study. The differences observed persisted on passaging and were transferred upon genome recombination.

The first isolation of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus from the blood and brain of a pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) captured in Moravia is reported. Complement-fixation (CF) tests with reference antisera revealed no relationship to any of a wide range of known arboviruses.

The effect of various concentrations of chicken leukocyte interferon was examined on the expression of adenovirus tumour (T) antigen in chick embryo cells. The inhibition of T antigen formation was dependent on the multiplicity of infection. The reduction of T antigen-producing cells was greater when interferon was applied before and after virus infection.

Very low infection rates (less than 3%) were obtained when Aedes aegypti mosquitoes ingested blood contained 5.8--6.5 log10 MLD50/0.02 ml African horse sickness virus (AHSV). When A. aegypti mosquitoes were inoculated intrathoracically with virus, however, high infection rates were achieved. Mosquitoes infected by inoculum failed to transmit virus to embryonated hens eggs by bite, and virus could not be detected in membrane or blood when inoculated mosquitoes were allowed to engorge on uninfected blood through a chick skin membrane. It was concluded that the mosquito A. aegypti is unlikely to be an effective vector of AHSV.

Electron microscope investigation of tissue of Phytoseiulus persimilis mites revealed its double infection with Rickettsiella phytoseiuli and virus-like particles. The presence of rickettsiae in tissues of the mite seemed to be decisive for establishment of virus infection.

Adult Swiss albino mice were immunized intravenously with flaviviviruses. Cellular immune response was studied by macrophage migration inhibition assay. Migration of cells from sensitized mice was significantly inhibited in the presence of homologous virus or antigen. Migration inhibition was also significant with serologically related viruses, thus establishing cross reaction in cellular immune response.

An analysis of the methods of testing the antiviral activity in vitro (in cell cultures) and in vivo (in experimental virus infections) is presented. The necessity of applying two-stage screening in vitro is emphasized. The chemotherapeutic viral models is in vitro testing as well as the principles of modelling of experimental viral infections are examined. Criteria for stage-by-stage assessment of the antiviral activity of the substances tested are formulated.

In order to evaluate the influence of antipsychotic drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia on therapy based on sensory integrative theory, this study, developed through library research, explores the theoretical bases for these two modes of treatment. Studies of chlorpromazine, a prototypical antipsychotic drug, show that its local action on the neurotransmitters of the brain may explain in theory its therapeutic efficacy. By citing evidence of sensory processing deficits in schizophrenic patients, a theoretical basis for the use of a sensory integrative approach to therapy is established. A comparison of these theories leads to the conclusion that a sensory integrative approach can serve as an important reinforcer of the therapeutic actions of chlorpromazine. Implications for treatment and research are considered.

The effect of nitroglycerin on arterial blood gases and cardiovascular hemodynamics were studied in patients with coronary artery disease. In 13 premedicated patients blood gases and cardiovascular hemodynamics were studied before and 10 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin (0.6 mg). In eight unpremedicated patients only blood gases were determined before and 10 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin 0.6 mg. All studies were performed before induction of anesthesia with the patients in the supine position breathing room air. In both groups, arterial PO2 decreased significantly (p less than 0.001); pH and pCO2 did not change. In the 13 patients on which hemodynamic studies were performed, the mean arterial pressure  (p less than 0.001), cardiac index (p less than 0.001), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), pulmonary artery (p less than 0.001) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (p less than 0.001) decreased. Calculated values for systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance were not significantly altered (p greater than 0.4). This study gives conclusive evidence that nitroglycerin reduces arterial PO2 in most patients with coronary artery disease breathing room air in the supine position. The possible mechanisms and clinical implications are discussed.

The counterimmunoelectrophoretic (CIE) procedure was evaluated under clinical laboratory conditions to determine its validity and comparability with culture methods. The procedure was further evaluated to determine applicability to a variety of clinical samples. An inexpensive set-up was developed to utilize the CIE procedure at bench level. Results indicated the procedure to be sensitive in detecting Haemophilus influenzae, type b, and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), group B. The procedure was more sensitive for detection of H. influenzae, type b, than for meningococcus, group B. The authors have confirmed the usefulness of the CIE procedure in the detection of group B streptococci, pneumococci and teichoic acid antibody to Staphylococcus aureus. Detection of Escherichia coli K 1 antigen was also accomplished by CIE. In the authors' laboratory the CIE procedure was superior to culture methods when used for the detection of H. influenzae, type b, and meningococcus group B.

The apparent stability of combinations of hydroxyzine hydrochloride and meperidine hydrochloride (50 mg/2 ml each) and of these two drugs (50 mg/2.5 ml each) and atropine sulfate (0.4 mg/2.5 ml) in prefilled glass and plastic syringes was studied. Syringes (3 ml) containing the combinations were stored at 25 C and 3 C for 10 days and analyzed at specific time intervals. Absorption spectra, chromatographic characteristics and pH were determined in addition to visual inspection. Results of these qualitative tests indicated that the mixtures apparently were stable for 10 days at room temperature or when refrigerated. No differences were found between solutions stored in glass and those stored in plastic syringes. Degradation of the syringe contents or appearance of additional constituents was not detected in any of the admixtures, and they were considered to be chemically compatible within the limitations of the study. The study suggests that storage of these combinations in syringes is feasible but the results cannot be extrapolated to drug solutions or syringes other than those studied.

The impetus for the development of the Gynecorps Training Program was the identification of medically underserved populations of women in Washington State and their need for preventive health care, the maldistribution of physicians, and the success of a pilot program for training midlevel personnel conducted in 1972 by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Washington School of Medicine. The program trains community-based and -sponsored Registered Nurses and Physician's Assistants as women's health-care specialists, with the goal of delivering preventive care in obstetrics and gynecology to populations of high-risk, low-income, and/or underserved women. A summary of the training program, its curriculum, and the integration of its graduates into community health teams is presented and discussed.

Diaphragms from rats under 24-h-old did not show the well-known increased transport of alpha-aminoisobutyrate found in older tissues in respone to insulin in vitro. A small effect was apparent by 3 days, and stimulation increased as donor rats aged (up to 4--5 wk). One-day diaphragms also had greater uptake than older tissues, due to both decreased Km and elevated Vmax. The change in insulin sensitivity did not result from alteration in the transport system used by alpha-aminoisobutyrate because uptake showed characteristics of the A system at both 1 day and older. Results suggest instead that the 1-day tissues had been made insulin-resistant by high insulin levels in donor animals. Plasma insulin levels of 1-day-old rats were 5 times those of 5-day animals. Elevating the plasma insulin levels of 5-day or 25- to 35-day rats led to a decreased effectiveness of insulin in vitro in stimulating alpha-aminoisobutyrate transport into their diaphragms. In the older animals, the stimulation was inversely proportional to the plasma insulin level 2 h after insulin injection.

The effect of acute respiratory alkalosis (ARA) on distal nephron H+ secretion was evaluated by measuring urine-to-blood (U-B) Pco2 in dogs with highly alkaline urine (urine pH greater than 7.8). ARA led to a significant decrease in U-B Pco2 and in urine HCO3 concentration; urine pH, however, increased significantly, indicating that the decrease in urine Pco2 was of greater magnitude than the decrease in urine HCO3 concentration. For any given urine HCO3 concentration urine Pco2 was lower (i.e., urine pH was higher) in ARA than in controls. Administration of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) during ARA resulted in a significant increase in U-B Pco2 to control values. In animals with moderately alkaline urine (urine pH 6.4--7.4) and high urine PO4 concentration, ARA resulted in a significant decrease in UB-Pco2 and urine PO4 concentrations. Neutral PO4 infusion in these dogs resulted in an increase in urine PO4 concentration and U-B Pco2 to control levels. These data demonstrate that ARA results in a significant decrease in U-B Pco2 that is not solely attributable to changes in urine HCO3 concentration. The observation that Tris and PO4 infusion during ARA raises U-B Pco2 to control levels suggests that the ability to secrete H+ is intact.

The modulation of tryptophan-oxygenase (TO) and tyrosine amino-transferase (TAT) in the rat liver after a single dose of hydrocortisone has been studied under various physiological conditions. Differences in the induction behavior of the two enzymes have been observed dependent on sex, age, amount of administered hormone, and presence or absence of the adrenals. Some of the results observed are the following: 1) TO reached its maximum induction level 3 h prior to TAT in normal male rats. This difference disappeared when adrenalectomized male rats or when female animals were tested. 2) The maximal induction values of both enzymes were 50--80% higher in adrenalectomized rats than in normal rats. This effect was independent of sex. 3) Higher doses of hydrocortisone were necessary for optimal induction of TO and TAT in normal than in adrenalectomized rats. 4) The minimum dose of hydrocortisone necessary for enzyme induction was significantly lower for TO than for TAT. 5) Actinomycin D caused a complete inhibition of the induction of TO and TAT when given simultaneously with the glucocorticoid. The inhibition was less complete the longer the interval between hormone and actinomycin D administration. The activity of TAT was suppressed to a larger extent than TO.

The pathways responsible for an the mechanisms underlying the adaptive increase in ammonia production in response to acidosis are considered. It seems unlikely that the cytosolic pathways (glutamine synthetase, glutaminase II, phosphate-independent glutaminase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase) are of primary importance in the adaptive process, but the role of the purine nucleotide cycle has not been resolved. The intramitochondrially located phosphate-dependent glutaminase pathway is generally believed to be of primary importance. Adaptation involved either enhanced glutamine entry into the mitrochondria and/or activation of phosphate-dependent glutaminase, but the relative importance of each has not been resolved definitively. The overall adaptive response is probably modulated by factors regulating alpha-ketoglutarate metabolism to phosphoenolpyruvate, and possibly also by metabolism of TCA cycle intermediates. It seems unlikely that a decrease in systemic pH is the direct effector for the acidosis-induced increase in ammonia formation; however, the resulting decrease in urine pH may play a critical role. Other potential messengers, including potassium, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, cyclic AMP, and calcium probably do not serve a primary function, but the importance of other circulating factor(s) is unclear.

A basic premise in the utilization of the plasma anion gap in the assessment of acid-base disorders is that this parameter remains constant during hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. Experimental data under in vitro conditions, however, cast serious doubt on this premise. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the plasma anion gap, estimated as (Na + K) - Cl + HCO3), in two large groups of dogs with graded degrees of chronic, HCl-induced metabolic acidosis or chronic, diuretic-induced metabolic alkalosis. The data indicate that the plasma anion gap decreases significantly in HCl acidosis and increases significantly in metabolic alkalosis; the predicted mean anion gap in animals with a plasma bicarbonate concentration of 10, 21 (normal), and 40 meq/liter approximated 13, 18, and 26 meq/liter, respectively. The observed variation in the plasma anion gap is interpreted as originating mainly from directional changes in the net negative charge of plasma proteins; these changes result from the titration process secondary to the altered plasma acidity and, in the case of metabolic alkalosis, from the additional effect of an increased plasma protein concentration.

Metabolic acidosis is known to be associated with increased blood potassium and phosphorus concentrations but the influence of mineral versus nonmineral acids on these variables remains undefined. Therefore, we infused anesthetized mongrel dogs with 0.45% saline (controls), the mineral acids HCl and NH4Cl, and the nonmineral acids lactic, beta-hydroxybutyric and methyl malonic for 1-3 h. Administration of both mineral acids was associated with significant increases in plasma potassium. In contrast, infusion of the three monmineral acids did not result in increases in plasma potassium; in fact, the levels decreased initially in the majority of the dogs. Phosphorus concentrations were increased by lactic and beta-hydroxybutric acids, were unchanged by NH4Cl and HCl, and were decreased by methyl malonic acid. Although the mechanisms responsible for these changes remain to be elucidated, the findings indicate that short-duration infusion of mineral and nonmineral acids has substantially different effects on plasma concentrations of these predominantly intracellular ions.

The use of marijuana as the independent variable produced a serious exacerbation of a psychotic process in four schizophrenic patients whose illness was otherwise well controlled with antipsychotic medication. Each patient served as his own control--the sole substance abused was marijuana and antipsychotic medication intake remained constant. Each time marijuana use at moderate levels began, there was exacerbation and deterioration. The author suggests that marijuana use is a special hazard to schizophrenic patients and that physicians should alert such high-risk patients to the possible untoward interaction between their illness and marijuana.

In a community survey, 41.8% of 771 men and 60.2% of 1,059 women reported having used one or more medications in the 48 hours before the interview. The use of medications and the number of medications used increased progressively with age among both men and women. Respondents who used four or more medications included significantly more high scores on a depression checklist than those who used fewer medications. The group of women who used minor tranquilizers and sedatives included significantly more high depression scorers than those who did not. Among both sexes, those scoring in the depressed range who were receiving psychotropic medication tended to be taking minor tranquilizers or sedatives.

The authors note an apparent unawareness of, as well as a paucity of recent literature pertaining to, hyperpyrexia as a complication of psychotropic drug treatment. They report a case of hyperpyrexia in a patient receiving psychotropic agents during a summer heat wave; massive muscle destruction (rhabdomyolysis) with myoglobinuria and acute renal failure make this case of particular interest. Causative mechanisms, preventive measures, and the benefits of prompt recognition and treatment of this condition are discussed.

For effective treatment of agoraphobia both patient and therapist must understand the mechanisms of sensitization and self-desensitization. Rather than aiming to adapt to difficult situations, to achieve desensitization by suggestions, or to avoid panic, the agoraphobe must learn to pass through panic and to rid oneself of drug dependency. This method of self-desensitization will, as a rule, achieve results quickly and does not necessarily depend upon finding the cause of the original sensitization.

Synthesis rates of glycosaminoglycans by WI-38 cultures (diploid, human fibroblasts exhibiting a limited number of population doublings in vitro) were determined by incorporation of 35S-sulfate of 14C-glucosamine into cellular and extracellular glycosaminoglycans at different passage levels before phase out. A progressive decline in the synthesis of cellular and extracellular glycosaminoglycans occured during the last (about 4) population doublings. 35S-sulfate incorporation into extracellular glycosaminoglycans appeared to be somewhat more reduced than 14-C-glucosamine incorporation during the last passages. Analysis of the distribution pattern of incorporated label into various glycosaminoglycan types (hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and possibly heparan sulfate) revealed an age-related relatively stonger decline of 14C-glucosamine incorporation into cellular and extracellular hyaluronic acid and of 35S-sulfate into extracellular chondroitin sulfate in comparison with the other glycosaminoglycan types. Addition of exogenous glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, heparin) at 100 microgram/ml to the culture media during the last 7 to 10 population doublings before phase out did not increase the total number of population-doublings. Heparin exhibited a significant growth inhibitory effect at 100 or 500 microgram/ml. The changes in glycosaminoglycan metabolism are interpreted as an expression of cellular ageing, and such an in vitro system offers a model for analyzing the factors involved in or causing the induction respectively prevention of this functional change.

Experimental data supporting a Unifying Concept of the molecular mechanisms of cellular aging and cellular neoplastic transformation of dividing cells in mass culture and clonal culture systems will be described. The Unifying Concept combines the hitherto antithetically presented Differentiation Theory, the Mutation Theory, the Error Catastrophy Theory and the Degradation Deficiency Theory with a newly worked out Virus Theory of the cellular aging and the cellular neoplastic transformation. Quantitative in vitro studies of embryonic fibroblast cell systems of two closely related inbred rat strains L.BN and Lewis were undertaken. The data obtained from the experimental analysis of the molecular mechanisms of the cellular aging and the cellular neoplastic transformation demonstrate, that the cellular aging of dividing cells is a Three-Stage-Differentiation Sequence under the control of three different genetic programs. The genetic constitution of the senescent cell regulates the expression of virogenes and oncogenes of the endogenous RNA tumor viruses of the C-type, resulting either in the cellular degeneration of the senescent cell under the control of the virogenes or in the cellular neoplastic transformation regulated by the oncogenes.

Primary mouse fibroblast cultures were established from 10 day old embryos of 3 inbred strains with a genetically determined different life expectancy. The capacity for unscheduled DNA synthesis following u.v. irradiation was studied in these cells at various passage levels. The mouse fibroblasts show considerable repair synthesis corresponding to the duration of exposure time. The capacity for induction of unscheduled DNA synthesis was different in the cells of each strain and correlated to the natural life span of the animal; in each case, however, the ability to perform repair synthesis was subjected to an age-associated decline.

In 30 students and 43 patients over 60 years the stimulation of enzymes in erythrocytes by pyridoxal-5-phosphate was tested. GOT in blood and erythrocytes was in the old patients diminished and showed higher values after stimulation.

The DNA-content of brain, testis and ovar of Wistar rats (inbred strain) was quantitatively analysed. We observed no significant differences between the several parts of the cerebrum, but between the cerebrum and the cerebellum. Furthermore we demonstrated alterations (with increase and decrease) of the DNA content of all brain parts as well as of testis and ovar during the course of life of this Wistar rat strain. These results and further investigations of the water content as well as of the absolute and of the relative weight of brains of these rats (in comparison to humans) extend the data and our knowledge about these subjects. It is possible to differentiate growth phases (by means of the DNA assays, which correlate with the morphologically well defined growth phases. Finally these results are fundamentals and presuppositions for investigations of the production metabolism of these organs because the DNA content is a better parameter (reference or relation figure, resp.) than the dry or wet weights and the protein or the nitrogen contents.

Little information about the possible neurochemical-enzymatic changes occuring during aging of human brain is available. We, therefore, investigated the activity of various enzymes of human brains obtained at autopsy and covering a range from 19 to 91 years. Protein kinase, which mediates the information carried by the second messenger cAMP, does not show age-related changes of basal activity. Cyclic AMP-dependent activation of protein kinase remains nearly constant up to 60 years of life, but undergoes a distinct and progressive decline between 60 and 90 years. In corpus striatum no age-related changes of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity were observed. The activity of carbonic anhydrase demonstrates in both human cortex and corpus striatum an age-dependent decrease which also begins after the 6th decade of life. These neurochemical changes are similar to morphological and physiological changes occuring in the aging brain. They begin after the 60th year of life.

It is well-known that the cAMP-adenylate cyclase system is important in mediating the effects of numerous hormones. We investigated the age-dependent behaviour of this system in aortas and femoral arteries of male Wistar rats (at the age of 10 days, 1, 4, 8, 12, and 22 months). It was found that: The basic adenylate cyclase activity had considerably been decreased beyond the first month of life, thereafter it was almost constant. The response of adenylate cyclase to guanylyl-imidodi-phosphate and NaF had essentially been elevated since the 4th month of age. The possibility of stimulating the cAMP generation due to epinephrine and histamine had substantially been increased since the 12th month of age. Besides the ability of adrenaline and histamine to stimulate the formation of cyclic AMP was investigated in broken cell preparation and intact cells of smooth muscle of the aorta and femoral artery of rats which had been subjected to daily intermittend immobilization of 1, 3, and 17 weeks. It was found that this type of stress led to an instability of the blood pressure which was associated with an increase in the sensitivity of adenylate cyclase in the broken cell preparations from the arteries to adrenaline and histamine and with a heightened cyclic AMP response to the two hormones in the intact arterial smooth muscle cells. The sensitivity of cardiac adenylate cyclase for adrenaline remained unchanged.

The use of "low-dose" heparin for the purpose of the prophylaxis of thrombosis is not yet general in the treatment of tetanus because this therapy may increase the risk of bleeding gastrointestinal stress-ulcers. The combination of heparin with histamine H2-receptor blockers, however, may be of therapeutic benefit and may reduce this complication as well as thrombosis. A case of tetanus and its therapy is reported.

Up until 1974 & 1975, Anesthesiologie observed with a certain reserve progress, which was nevertheless spectacular, in the physiological aspects of pain. The fundamental theory of the inhibition of small algophoric fibres by large fibres (NOOR-DENBOS, 1959), the striking theory of spinal control (WALL and MELZACK, 1965) and even the detection of morphine receptors at the same time paradoxically were associated with little enthusiasm here with only a minimum of mention in the journals. Why this lack of enthusiasm? Undoubtedly because new theories remain speculative when viewed from our own standpoint. Since we have been in existence, our methods of general anesthesia have been based upon solid pharmacological concepts but generally paid little attention to physiology which was of relatively little use and even failed to shed any light upon the pharmacology already mentioned. Our attitude was diametrically opposed to that of neurosurgery which by contrast remained within the technical furrow of physiology. The arrival of encephalins forces us to leave behind such attitudes for three reasons: 1--they clearly throw light into the darkness of a whole area of pharmacology; 2--they open up a pharmacological persepective; 3--they raise a number of theoretical and practical questions, which range from their phylogenesis to the hope of one day possessing morphine-like substances without side-effects.

1--The classical notion attributing the conduction of painful messages to only the A delta and C fibres will be discussed. 2--Spinal cord cells of layers I, V and VIII received painful messages and their physiological properties will be compared. 3--The origin within the cell layers of the spinal cord of the various ascending bundles will be examined. 4--The reticular an thalamic zones (posterior ventra nucleus, mid-line and intralaminar nuclei, GMme posterior group in particular) which receive painful messages have also been studied using activation provoked by pinching, pinprick, the injection of painful substances and stimulation of the dental pulp. The possible role of the different structures thereby brought into action and the limitation of these techniques will be discussed. 5--The existence of metameric controls and controls of central origin active at a spinal, reticular and thalamic level. The absence of inhibitory controls may be responsible for the development of abnormal painful sensations which accompany certain deafferentation procedures. The reestablishment of these controls with the aid of stimulation may result and often results in the improvement of these painful syndromes. 6--Section of the dorsal routes in the chronic animal (rat and cat) may represent an experimental model for deafferentation pain seen in man.

Morphine, the principal alkaloid of "papaver somniferum" is the reference substance of central analgesics, the parmacodynamic constants of which are: analgesia and the possibility of addiction. Respiratory depression is, for many of them, a grave side-effect. At the present time, no substance in this category is fully satisfactory and all may result in dependence. Equi-analgesic doses of dextromoramide, phenoperidine and Fentanyl are less than those of morphine, whilst those of pethidine and pentazocine are higher. Study of the pharmacokinetics of these various substances indicates no common elements, and it is difficult to consider that the analgesic action is proportional to blood levels. Clinical assessment of the mean duration of action makes it possible to divide morphine derivatives into substances with a very short action (20 to 45 minutes) such as Febtanyl and phenoperidine, and those with a longer action (1 to 4 hours) which includes the majority of the other substances. The analgesic activity of Methoadone lasts for 4 to 6 hours. Morphine antagonists such as Methadone, nalophine, naloxone and naltrexone possess specific problems in terms of their utilization. Pharmacological data concerning theses substances are described.

Recent Neurobiological (Neurophysiological, Histochemical, Neurochemical and behavioural studies) data have indicated that the analgesic effects of morphine may, at least in part, be explained by two modes of action. A--Morphine has a direct depressive action at a spinal level on the activity of neurones of the grey matter of the dorsal horn which run towards the higher centres of the encephalon. These effects are exerted preferentially on activities induced by the activity of fine non-myelinized fibres (C). These mechanisms are discussed taking into account recent data concerning polypeptides (substance P and encephalins). B--Morphine acts at the level of the brain stem (periaqueductal grey matter, raphian nucleus, etc.) reinforcing the activity of descending bulbo-spinal pathways which block the transmission of painful messages within the cord.

Four years ago, sterospecific sites for the bending of opiates were discovered within the brain of animals and the human being. All of the properties of these sites are in conformity with the proposition that they are pharmacological receptors which have long been postulated for these drugs. The binding of morphine or of one of its derivatives to these sites should result in chemical or physical reactions leading to well known pharmacological responses. These reactions following the binding of drugs to the receptors are not yet known, but there is some evidence that cyclical nucleotides play a role. The affinity of a whole series of morphine derivatives, agonists and atagonists, is well correlated with their pharmacological effectiveness. In the presence of sodium salts, antagonists become more strongly bound and agonists less strongly than in the absence of sodium. The evidence is presented. This is explained by an equilibrium between two formations of the receptor: one characteristic of the absence of sodium and one of its presence. Receptors are found in the nervous system of all vertebrates and their distribution has been studied in the human brain. The regions with the highest concentration of receptors are those of the limbic system. A high level exists also in the "substantia gelatinosa" of the spinal cord, which is involved in the passage of painful messages. Study of the function of morphine receptors has led to the isolation, in animal brain, of a number of peptides with morphine properties named endorphines. The first two endorphines isolated were pentapeptides named encephalins. The properties of endorphines from the subject of several lecture in this course.

The influence of micro-iontophoretically administered opiates and opiate peptides on the activity of single neurones in the central nervous system will be discussed. It will be shown that in single neurone studies in several different supraspinal regions opiates and opiate peptides have similar actions on individual neurones and both may excite or depress neuronal activity. The excitatory and inhibitory effects of these substances can be reversed by a necrotic antagonist and therefore may be mediated via an action at specific opiate receptors. Studies on spinal neurons indicate that the excitatory action of morphine and enkephalin may be due to an interaction with a cholinergic receptor or at least cholinoceptive neurones. Evidence will also be presented showing that responses of dorsal horn neurones to nowious peripheral stimuli may be selectively reduced by morphine and enkephalin administered into the substantia gelatinosa region or the spinal cord. The relevance of these observations to the pharmacological action of opiates and the possible physiological function of endogenous opiate peptides will be mentioned.

Transcutaneous electrotherapy has been employed in 112 patients with chronic pains of various origins. The immediate and long term results are not considered, at whole, satisfactory, especially for length and quality of the obtained improvement. Only patients with chronic post-zoosterian neuralgia had good results, or immediate either at long term, especially in intercostal pains. In the contrary in acute cases of this nevralgia, there were not satisfactory improvements.

A comparative study of the effects of electro-acupuncture of the HO KU point and of a placebo control point were carried out in man, taking as an objective test of pain the threshold of a pain induced flexion reflex. In the absence of electrical stimulation of the HO KU point, or of the control point, no variation in the painful reflex threshold was seen. This remained stable throughout the experimental session. However, electrical stimulation of the HO KU point resulted in a 115 p. 100 increase in the reflex threshold, whilst that of the control point resulted in an increase of 20 p. 100 in the threshold of the same reflex. These results are discussed on the basis of data in the literature.

We have studied the effects of electrical acupuncture stimulation and transcutaneous electrical stimulation on the ability of human volunteers to perceive pain. Both psychophysical indices and measures of cerebral evoked responses to painful stimuli have been used to demonstrate that these treatments reduce pain perception. A recently completed study showed that the analgesic effects of transcutaneous electrical stimulation can be partly reversed when 0,4 mg of naloxone is injected. This observation suggests that endogenic morphine-like peptides are released in response to low frequency electrical stimulation of the skin.

A study of 12 patients suffering from chronic lumbar pain led to a comparison of the results of treatment with traditional acupuncture and that with transcutaneous electrical stimulation. The degree and quality of pain, as well as the duration of relief after treatment, were analyzed in an attempt to differentiate between the two forms of analgesia. Statistical analysis of the two methods showed no significant difference. Not only did they appear to have the same therapeutic merit, but it would also seem reasonable to suppose that they have a common mechanism at their origin. Intense stimulation of trigger points followed by relief of pain led us to compare them to acupuncture zones both in terms of topography and characteristics. There was a certain analogy of distribution, associated with a similarity of expression which led us to consider that these two techniques were possibly related to the same neurological process.

This report concerns the current status of the results of intraencephalic implantations carried out up to the present time in man with the aim of relieving certain forms of chronic pain. It places little emphasis upon the neuro-physiological basis of these implantations, which have been studied at length during previous reports. After presenting the overall results of operations carried out in the world up until September 1967, a critical study is undertaken: 1--In relation to the targets (Postero-Lateral Ventral Nucleus, posterior arm of the internal capsule, para-ventricular thalamic grey matter). 2--In relation to etiologies, both analytically (syndrome) by syndrome as well as in terms of synthesis (excess of pain perception-deafferentation). 3--In terms of various factors, such as: --technical requirements; --side ffects; --duration of "post effect" (residual analgesia after stimulation); --parallel action of drugs. Conclusions are drawn concerning future perspectives of this technique.

Hypophysectomy leads to a small increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity of all brain areas containing noradrenergic neurons or tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons, but nigroneostriatal dopamine neurons are not so affected. ACTH or corticosterone treatment inhibited this effect of hypophysectomy in some noradrenergic neurons and in tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons. These data showing differential responsiveness of tyrosine hydroxylase in different brain areas are compatible with differences in regulation or molecular form of tyrosine hydroxylase in central noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons. The disparity between increased hypothalamic tyrosine hydroxylase activity and decreased norepinephrine turnover following hypophysectomy may result from a change in the rate-limiting step to the hydroxylation of dopamine.

Contrary to the the tubercle bacilli (H37Ra, BCG), Mycobacterium phlei, grown on Sauton medium, formed the NAD+ dependent dehydrogenases that catalyse the oxidation of ribitol, sorbitol and mannitol. These enzymes were separated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200. In the present work we have principally studied the ribitol dehydrogenase. All the experiments for induction of the ribitol dehydrogenase in H37Ra or BCG were negative; whereas after the adaptation of M. phlei to ribitol, the specific activity of this enzyme increased in the supernatants more than 100 per cent. The ribitol dehydrogenase of M. phlei reduced NAD+ not only in the presence of ribitol but also (though to a lesser extent) in the presence of erythritol and glycerol. Other properties studied concerning this enzyme and the reaction it catalyses were: pH dependence, equilibrium constant, Km and sensitivity towards the inhibitors of the thiol groups.

The ocular hypotensive efficacy of continuously delivered epinephrine is compared to that of pulsed doses provided by eyedrops in both normotensive and hypertensive rabbit eyes. In normotensive eyes, 2 microgram/hr and 4 microgram/hr epinephrine delivered into the tear film continuously for 12 hours reduces intraocular pressure as well as eyedrop pulses of 0.5% epinephrine hydrochloride or 2% epinephrine bitartrate (doses of 500 and 1100 microgram, respectively). Ocular hypertension induced by an intragastric water load in rabbits is significantly inhibited by continuous delivery of epinephrine at the rates of 3 or 6 microgram/hr, or by 2% epinephrine bitartrate (1% free base) eyedrops. Epinephrine delivered continuously at rates of 2-6 microgram/hr for 6 to 12 hours (12-72 microgram total) has hypotensive efficacy equivalent to 15 to 40 times as much epinephrine applied once in eyedrops. Epinephrine bitartrate eyedrops reduce tear film pH well below normal. Continuous delivery of epinephrine bitartrate does not reduce tear film pH below normal levels.

New and improved methods for concentrating enteroviruses, reoviruses, and adenoviruses from oysters have been developed and evaluated. Viruses are efficiently adsorbed to homogenized oyster meat by adjusting the homogenate to pH 5.0 and a conductivity of less than or equal to 2,000 mg of NaCl per liter. After low-speed centrifugation, the virus-free supernatant is discarded and the viruses are eluted from the sedimented oyster solids with pH 7.5 glycine-NaCl having a conductivity of 8,000 mg of NaCl per liter. The oyster solids are removed by low-speed centrifugation and filtration, and the viruses in the filtered supernatant are concentrated to a small volume by either ultrafiltration or acid precipitation at pH 4.5. The concentrate is treated with antibiotics and inoculated into cell cultures for virus isolation and quantitation. When these methods were tested with oysters experimentally contaminated with polioviruses, reoviruses, and adenoviruses, recovery efficiencies averaged about 46%. With the exception of virus assay and quantitation, these methods are simple and inexpensive enough to be done in typical shellfish microbiology laboratories.

The abilities of ammonia and related compounds to inactivate poliovirus were compared. Compounds virucidal at pH 9.5 had the following order of activities: ethylamine greater than propylamine, dimethylamine, methylamine greater than ammonia greater than 2-methoxyethylamine.

Chemical and physical stabilities of bacteriophages øUW 21 and øUW 51 infecting Micromonospora purpurea ATCC 15835 were examined. Both phages were stable over the pH range of 5 to 8 and to heating at temperatures up to 50 degrees C and especially stable in buffer containing magnesium ion. Exposure to 1 M Ca(NO3)2 inactivated both phages, and phage øUW 51 was also susceptible to 1 M CaCl2, 0.1 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, and 0.3% H2O2. Phage plating efficiency was highest on the cultures at logarithmic phase and sometimes much influenced by host growth. Phage øUW 51 has a latent period of 2 h at 34 degrees C and a burst size between 35 and 40. The latent period for phage øUW 21 is about 12 h, and the burst size is smaller than 30.

The development and evaluation of methods for the quantitative recovery of enteroviruses from sewage sludge are reported. Activated sewage sludge solids were collected by centrifugation, and elution of the solid-associated virus was accomplished by mechanical agitation in glycine buffer at pH 11.0. Eluted viruses were concentrated either onto an aluminum hydroxide floc or by association with a floc which formed de novo upon adjustment of the glycine eluate to pH 3.5. Viruses which remained in the liquid phase after lowering the pH of glycine eluate were concentrated by adsorption to and elution from membrane filters. The method of choice included high pH glycine elution and subsequent low pH concentration; it yielded an efficiency of recovery from activated sludge of 80% for poliovirus type 1, 68% for echovirus type 7, and 75% for coxsackievirus B3. This method was used to study the survival of naturally occurring virus in sludge at a sewage treatment plant and after subsequent land disposal of the solids after aerobic digestion. Reduction of enterovirus titers per gram (dry weight) of solids were modest during sludge activation but increased to a rate of 2 log 10/week after land disposal.

Poliovirus type 1, coxsackievirus type A9, and echovirus type 7 were inactivated by sodium bisulfite and ascorbic acid. Inactivation rates depended upon concentration, temperature, and pH. RNA infectivity was lost during inactivation; the capsid was also altered by these inactivating agents, as determined by enzyme sensitivity assays and by tests of adsorption to cells. Structural modifications of the virus particles were not identical, suggesting that the mechanism of inactivation by ascorbic acid differs from that of sodium bisulfite.

Fourteen different broth media were autoclaved under anaerobic conditions and then exposed to atmospheric oxygen. The hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical formation as well as the bactericidal effect of the media were studied. The rate of killing of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius VPI 4330-1 was high in media that rapidly autoxidized and accumulated hydrogen peroxide. In actinomyces broth (BBL), 50% of the cells were killed within 2 min, and in Brewer thioglycolate medium (Difco), 50% were killed within 11 min, whereas more than 50% of the cells survived for more than 2 h in Clausen medium (Oxoid), fluid thioglycolate medium (BBL), and thioglycolate medium without dextrose or indicator (Difco). Only media that contained phosphate and glucose had a tendency to accumulate hydrogen peroxide. A solution of phosphate and glucose autoxidized when it had been heated to 120 degrees C for at least 5 min and when the pH of the solution was higher than 6.5. Transitional metal ions catalyzed the autoxidation, but they were not necessary for the reaction to occur. Of the other substances heated in phosphate buffer, only alpha-hydroxycarbonyl compounds autoxidized with accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Superoxide dismutase decreased the autoxidation rate of most of the broth media. This indicated that superoxide radicals were generated in these media.

The presence and partial characterization of the internal acid protease (EC 2.4.23.6) of Aspergillus oryzae has been investigated. Although the majority of the acid protease is external and present in the culture filtrate, a significant amount of the active enzyme is firmly bound to the cells; it is not released by repeated extraction of cells with 0.9% sodium chloride but is liberated into the soluble fraction during disruption of cells. The internal acid protease, as well as the external one, was separated into two major molecular forms (F1 and F2) with molecular weights of 60,000 and 42,000, respectively, by chromatography on Sephadex G-100 and on CM-Sephadex C-50. The partially purified internal enzymes had the same catalytic and immunological properties, as did the external enzyme.

Samples for mycological analysis were collected from surfaces in the Skylab spacecraft before launch and during flight for each manned mission. Fungal contamination levels were low during the first two flights; however, the species recovered were different for each mission. On the third mission, widespread contamination of the Skylab spacecraft with Aspergillus and Pencillium spp. was detected. This contamination was traced to several contaminated space suit undergarments.

Phthalate is degraded through 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate and protocatechuate in Pseudomonas testosteroni NH1000. The ezyme 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase, catalyzing the conversion of 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate to protocatechuate and carbon dioxide, was purified approximately 130-fold from phthalate-induced cells of a protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase-deficient mutant of P. testosteroni. The most purified preparation showed a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide disc gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of 38,000. The apparent molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by Sephadex G-200 column chromatography was 150,000. Among the substrate analogs tested, only 4-hydroxyphthalate served as a substrate, which was decarboxylated to form m-hydroxybenzoate. The apparent Km values for 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate and 4-hydroxyphthalate were estimated to be 10.5 micrometer and 1.25 mM, respectively, and the Vmax for the former was 10 times larger than that for the latter. Whereas the wild-type strain could utilize 4-hydroxyphthalate as a sole source of carbon, none of the following could grow with the compound: 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase-deficient, m-hydroxybenzoate-nondegradable, and protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase-deficient mutants. Since one-step revertants of these mutants could utilize 4-hydroxyphthalate, the compound appears to be metabolized through m-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate in P. testosteroni NH1000.

Sheep muscle tissue removed aseptically from control carcasses, from uneviscerated carcasses held at 20 degrees C for 24 h, and from carcasses of sheep subjected to stress before slaughter was examined for the presence of bacteria. All samples from a total of 68 carcasses were sterile. Whole-body autoradiography of mouse carcasses showed that 14C-labeled fixed bacteria injected after death remained in the lumen of the intestine. Live bacteria did not penetrate the mucosal surface until the tissue structure had been disrupted by proteolytic enzymes. Bacteria were unable to penetrate sections of intestine longitudinally until considerable structural breakdown had occurred, indicating that blood and lymph vessels do not normally offer a pathway for microbial invasion from the intestine. Clostridia, which have been reported to be responsible for deep spoilage of meat, reached maximum numbers 24 to 28 h after death in the intestines of guinea pig carcasses stored at 20 degrees C, but did not invade carcass tissues until the stomach ruptured as a result of proteolysis between 2 and 3 days after death.

Dark, firm, dry meat contains little or no glucose. Therefore, spoilage bacteria growing on such meat immediately attack amino acids so that spoilage odors and ammonia are detectable at comparatively low cell densities (about 10(6)/cm2).

A procedure is described for establishing a heat inactivation curve for the toxin of Clostridium botulinum 62A in beef broth. The effect of toxin titer, pH, and the type of acid employed for pH adjustment on the heat stability of the toxin is described.

Entamoeba histolytica homogenates are capable of hydrolyzing a range of inorganic and organic pyrophosphates. Two separate activities are present: an inorganic pyrophosphatase hydrolyzing inorganic pyrophosphate and linear tripolyphosphate, and a nucleoside diphosphatase hydrolyzing thiamine pyrophosphate and nucleoside diphosphates (ADP, GDP and UDP). The inorganic pyrophosphatase has an acid pH optimum, a relatively high KM (congurent to 1 micrometer) and is markedly heat stable and lacks a metal requirement. The nucleoside diphosphatase also has an acid pH optimum but displays a much higher affinity for substrate (KM congurent to 50 micrometer), is unstable to heating and is activated by Ca ions. Both pyrophosphatases distinct from the acid phosphatase activity which is also present. All three hydrolases are sedimentable and latent suggesting their association with membrane bounded organelles. No soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase activity could be demonstrated.

Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2), an enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, was cytochemically localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of sclerotia-like cells of submerged Claviceps purpurea Tul. producing clavine alkaloids. The enzymic activity was structurally bound in unit membranes of ER strands which, later on, evolved into vacuoles containing lipoprotein material. The reaction product was absent from ER in nonvacuolized filamentous hyphae and ovoid asexual spores containing numerous lipid globules; it was also absent from ER in the mycelium of submerged C. purpurea strain producing no alkaloids. In view of our previous morphogenetic observations and the available biochemical evidence, the observed localization of acetyl-CoA carboxylase was assumed not to coincide with fatty acid biosynthesis but to represent sites of alkaloid synthesis.

The involvement of reactions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in autotrophic CO2 fixation in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was investigated. The incorporation of succinate into glutamate (= alpha-ketoglutarate), aspartate (= oxaloacetate) and alanine (= pyruvate) was studied. The organism was grown on H2 plus CO2 at pH 6.5 in the presence of 1 mM [U-14C-]succinate. Significant amounts of the dicarboxylic acid were incorporated into cellular material under these conditions. Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate were isolated and their specific radioactivities were determined. Only glutamate was found to be labelled. Degradation of glutamate revealed that C-1 of glutamate was derived from CO2 and C-2--C-5 from succinate indicating that in M. thermoautotrophicum alpha-ketoglutarate is synthesized via reductive carboxylation of succinyl CoA. The finding that succinate was not incorporated into alanine and aspartate excludes that oxaloacetate and pyruvate are synthesized from alpha-ketoglutarate via isocitrate or citrate. This is taken as evidence that a complete reductive carboxylic acid cycle is not involved here in autotrophic CO2 fixation.

The formation of cellulases and beta-glucosidase and their location in the fungus Phialophora malorum was studied on some different carbon sources. The cellulases were found to be partly cell-free and partly cell-bound during growth on cellulose and carboxymethyl-cellulose. Glucose and cellobiose repressed the cellulase formation but a low carboxymethylcellulase activity was measurable on the glucose-grown mycelium. The unicellular stage did not appear to grow on carboxymethyl-cellulose or cellulose, but mycelium was formed on these carbon sources.

A sterile glucose-mineral salts broth was inoculated with conidia of Penicillium rubrum P-13 and P-3290. Radiolabeled compounds were added to some cultures, these being incubated quiescently at 28 degrees C for 14 days. Other stationary cultures were grown for 21 days, received labeled compounds, and were then grown for 5 more days. The remaining cultures were inoculated with 72-h-old mycelial pellets, received labeled materials and were incubated with shaking for 60 h. Rubratoxin was resolved by thin-layer chromatography. Labeled [1(14)C]acetate, [1,5(14)C]citrate, [2(14)C]malonate, [1(14)C]glucose, [U14C]glucose or [1(14)C]hexanoate were incorporated into rubratoxins A and B by P. rubrum 3290 and into rubratoxin B by P. rubrum 13. Incorporation of [1(14)C]acetate and [2(14)C]malonate increased when exogenous unlabeled acetate, malonate, pyruvate, or phosphoenol-pyruvate was added. Acetate incorporation was influenced by cultural conditions, attaining maximum amounts in quiescent cultures which received labeled acetate after 21 days of incubation. Acetate incorporation in shake cultures was enhanced by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and by unlabeled exogenous citrate.

Utilization of D-amino acids being substrates of D-amino acid dehydrogenase of Salmonella typhimurium was examined. The experiments were done with wild type strains and the mutants dadA missing the enzyme activity and dadR in which its synthesis is released from catabolite repression. Growth on D-tryptophan, D-histidine and D-methionine used as precursors of the L-amino acids was faster when the respective auxotrophs carried dadR mutations. The dadR mutants grew faster when D-or L-alanine was present as a sole source of nitrogen. Experiments with D-amino acid dehydrogenase in vitro provided evidence that D-tryptophan is its substrate with a very low affinity to the dehydrogenase.

It has been suggested that, if dopamine antagonism is a necessary condition for the antischizophrenic action of neuroleptics, the prolactin response, as an index of dopamine blockade, would correlate with clinical response. Morning prolactin and clinical symptomatology were measured in 15 schizophrenic patients before neuroleptic therapy, and after three and six weeks of high-dose butaperazine or loxapine treatment. Prolactin levels were transiently elevated during the unmedicated admission period, probably reflecting a normal stress response. Prolactin increased in all patients during neuroleptic therapy. There was, however, no correlation between magnitude of prolactin changes and clinical response, probably because the prolactin response achieved a maximum at relatively low doses of neuroleptics.

Arylsulfatase A (ASA) activity in urine and serum was assayed on two 21-month-old monozygotic twins with presumed metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), their parents, and kin. The patients showed a marked reduction in ASA activity in both urine and serum. The twins' parents and 11 kin, a total of 13 persons, were examined for ASA activity in serum, but it was not possible to delineate heterozygous carriers of MLD by the present study. The assay of ASA activity in serum promises to be useful for diagnosis of MLD.

Research since 1960 was reviewed to compare the relative efficacy of behavior therapy and other therapy modalities in the treatment of flight phobias in trained military aircrew, commercial flight crews, and civilian air travellers. Results indicated that treatment programs involving behavior therapy techniques appeared to have a higher success rate than treatment programs not involving these techniques, especially in cases of focal fear with acute onset under stressful conditions. Other conditions for optimal outcome are outlined and hypotheses for a more programmatic research effort discussed.

1. GAMMA-Glutamylcyclotransferase was purified 10000-fold from human erythrocytes. 2. The purification steps involved fractionation with (NH4)(2)SO(4) and chromatography on Sephadex G-75, DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite. The purified enzyme was found to be homogeneous on density-gradient polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. 3. The maximum reaction rate was observed at pH9.0 and the apparent Km value for gamma-glutamyl-L-alanine was 2.2mM. 4. The molecular weight (25250) of the purified enzyme agreed well with the value (25500) in fresh haemolysates, indicating no apparent structural modification of the enzyme during purification. However, rapid processing of the blood through the initial (NH4)(2)SO(4) and Sephadex-chromatography steps was required to prevent formation of a high-molecular-weight aggregate with substantially lower specific activity. 5. gamma-Glutamylcyclotransferase catalyses the formation of 5-oxoproline from gamma-glutamyl dipeptides. The role of this enzyme in erythrocytes is of particular interest, because gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteine serves as a substrate for both gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase and glutathione synthetase. Thus the cyclotransferase could modulate glutathione synthesis.

Maltase-glucoamylase, a microvillous membrane ectoenzyme, was solubilized from rat intestinal mucosa by digestion with papain and subsequently purified to homogeneity with an overall yield of 10--20%. An antibody to the purified enzyme formed a single precipitin line in immunodiffusion experiments with an intestinal homogenate. The enzyme was shown to be an acidic glycoprotein (20% sugar by weight) which contained low amounts of cysteine and no sialic acid. At pH3--6, maltase activity was slowly lost, but the enzyme was re-activated by re-adjustment of the pH to neutrality. However, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate, acid pH values inactivated maltase irreversibly, and at the same time converted the enzyme (mol.wt. 500000 approx.) into five new species with apparent molecular weights ranging from 134000 to 480000 as judged by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The same five fragments were also formed by boiling the enzyme for brief periods in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate or urea either with or without reducing agents. The dissociated species were stable on re-electrophoresis, and amino acid analysis showed them to be very similar to each other and to the original enzyme. The bands migrated anomalously on polyacrylamide gels of different concentration, thereby preventing the assignment of precise molecular weights. It is possible that the five species may represent stable aggregates of a common monomer of the enzyme.

The capacities of Procion Red HE-3B and Cibacron Blue F3G-A immobilized to Sepharose CL-4B and Matrex 201R for NAD+-, NADP+- and NAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenases were measured. Procion Red HE-3B columns retarded NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases more effectively than NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases, whilst immobilized Cibacron Blue F3G-A retarded NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases more effectively than NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases. The capacity of procion Red HE-3B-Sepharose CL-4B for five dehydrogenases was highest in the region of 70nmol of immobilized ligand/ml of settled gel. The effects of using poly(ethyleneimine) as a spacer for both porous and pellicular supports were also examined. Four NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases were purified from yeast extract by using Procion Red HE-3B-Sepharose CL-4B. Two NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases were purified from the same source using Cibacron Blue F3G-A-Sepharose CL-4B. These results are discussed in relation to the use of immobilized Procion Red HE-3B to purify dehydrogenases. This immobilized dye's chromatograhic behaviour is compared with that of immobilized nucleotides. The most important feature of immobilized tirazine dyes seems to be their high operational capacities when compared with group-specific nucleotide adsorbents.

1. The pH-dependencies of the binding of NADH and reduced nicotinamide--benzimidazole dinucleotide to pig heart cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase are reported. 2. Two ionizing groups were observed in the binding of both reduced coenzymes to lactate dehydrogenase. One group, with pKa in the range 6.3--6.7, is the active-site histidine residue and its deprotonation weakens binding of reduced coenzyme 3-fold. Binding of both coenzymes is decreased to zero when a second group, of pKa 8.9, deprotonates. This group is not cysteine-165.3. Only one ionization is required to characterize the binding of the two reduced coenzymes to malate dehydrogenase. The group involved appears to be the active-site histidine residue, since its ethoxycarbonylation inhibits the enzyme and abolishes binding of reduced coenzyme. Binding of either reduced coenzyme increases the pKa of the group from 6.4 to 7.4, and deprotonation of the group is accompanied by a 10-fold weakening of coenzyme binding. 4. Two reactive histidine residues were detected per malate dehydrogenase dimer. 5. A mechanism which emphasizes the homology between the two enzymes is presented.

Human carbonmonoxy- and deoxy-haemoglobins were incubated at 37 degrees C in 3H2O at various pH values to measure the pH-dependent hydrogen--tritium exchange at the C-2 position of the imidazole ring of histidine-122alpha. To obtain the pseudo-first-order rate constants for the exchange, k, the two peptides containing histidine-122alpha were isolated and the amounts of tritium incorporated were determined. The rate constants gave pK values for the histidine of 6.1 in carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin and 6.6 in deoxyhaemoglobin, showing that it contributes about 20% to the total alkaline Bohr effect and about 10% at pH7.4.

Rat liver homogenate was incubated at 37 degrees C with thyroxine, 3,3',5-tri-iodothyronine, 3,3',5'-tri-iodothyronine or 3,3'-di-iodothyronine. The degradation or accumulation of these compounds was measured by specific radioimmunoassays. (1) Production of 3,3',5-tri-iodothyronine from thyroxine was highest at pH 6.0--6.5 and was markedly stimulated by the addition of dithiothreitol and effectively inhibited in the presence of 6-propyl-2-thiouracil. (2) Accumulation of 3,3',5'-tri-iodothyronine on incubation of thyroxine with homogenate was only observed above pH 8.5. Otherwise the product was converted into 3,3'-di-iodothyronine too rapidly to allow its measurement. By measuring 3,3'-di-iodothyronine it was deduced that 5-deiodination of thyroxine was most effective at approx. pH 8.0. Dithiothreitol powerfully stimulated this reaction and 6-propyl-2-thiouracil strongly inhibited. (3) Monodeiodination of the tyrosine ring of 3,3',5-tri-iodothyronine was the slowest reaction, was optimal at pH 8.0 and was less affected by dithiothreitol and 6-propyl-2-thiouracil than the above reactions. (4) 5'-Deiodination of 3,3',5'-tri-iodothyronine was extremely rapid, with a pH optimum probably at about 6.5. Owing to the high reaction rate under the conditions used it was not possible to assess the effects of dithiothreitol and 6-propyl-2-thiouracil.

1. Under optimal ionic conditions (4 mM-MnCl2) the specific activity of guanylate cyclase in fresh platelet lysates was about 10nmol of cyclic GMP formed/20 min per mg of protein at 30 degrees C. Activity was 15% of optimum with 10mM-MgCl2 and negligible with 4mM-CaCl2. Synergism between MnCl2 and MgCl2 or CaCl2 was observed when [MnCl2] less than or equal to [GPT]. 2. Lower than optimal specific activities were obtained in assays containing large volumes of platelet lysate, owing to the presence of inhibitory factors that could be removed by ultrafiltration. Adenine nucleotides accounted for less than 50% of the inhibitory activity. 3. Preincubation of lysate for 1 h at 30 degrees C increased the specific activity of platelet guanylate cyclase by about 2-fold. 4. Lubrol PX (1%, w/v) stimulated guanylate cyclase activity by 3--5-fold before preincubation and by about 2-fold after preincubation. Triton X-100 was much less effective. 5. Dithiothreitol inhibited the guanylate cyclase activity of untreated, preincubated and Lubrol PX-treated lysates and prevented activation by preincubation provided that it was added beforehand. 6. Oleate stimulated guanylate cyclase activity 3--4-fold and arachidonate 2--3-fold, whereas palmitate was almost inactive. Pretreatment of lysate with indomethacin did not inhibit this effect of arachidonate. Oleate and arachidonate caused marked stimulation of guanylate cyclase in preincubated lysate, but inhibited the enzyme in Lubrol PX-treated lysate. 7. NaN3 (10mM) increased guanylate cyclase activity by up to 7-fold; this effect was both time- and temperature-dependent. NaN3 did not further activate the enzyme in Lubrol PX-treated lysate. 8. The results indicated that preincubation, Lubrol PX, fatty acids and NaN3 activated platelet guanylate cyclase by different mechanisms. 9. Platelet particulate fractions contained no guanylate cyclase activity detectable in the presence or absence of Lubrol PX that could not be accounted for by contaminating soluble enzyme, suggesting that physiological aggregating agents may increase cyclic GMP in intact platelets through the effects of intermediary factors. The activated and inhibited states of the enzyme described in the present paper may be relevant to the actions of these factors.

The subcellular distribution of nine glycosidases were studied in fractions of homogenized human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (neutrophils) obtained by isopycnic centrifugation through linear sucrose density gradients. The substrates were 4-methylumbelliferyl glycosides. All nine glycosides were hydrolysed by enzymes in neutrophil cytosol fractions, and by enzymes in at least one granule population. alpha-Glucosidase activity sedimented in sucrose density gradients to a point (p = 1.180 g/ml) just above the specific granules, possibly the 'tertiary' granule population. The peak corresponding to alpha-glucosidase did not co-sediment with, but considerably overlapped, the peak corresponding to lactoferrin, a marker for specific granules (p = 1.187 g/ml). alpha-Galactosidase activity was found primarily in heavy azurophil granules (p = 1.222 g/ml). alpha-Mannosidase activity was found primarily in light azurophil granules (p = 1.206 g/ml), following the distribution of myeloperoxidase, the commonly used azurophil granule marker. beta-Glucosidase activity was concentrated in mitochondrial fractions (p = 1.160 g/ml). All other glycosidases presented complex distributions, with activities not restricted to one granule class. Granule-associated glycosidase activities were increased 2--38 times when measured in the presence of 0.05% Triton X-100, indicating latency of the enzymes within granules.

1. The antihypertensive effect of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, trimepranol (10--14 mg/twice daily), chlorthalidone (50 mg every second day) and their combination was studied in eighteen patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In a controlled randomized cross-over study the drugs were given for 6 week periods. 2. A significant and equal decrease in blood pressure was achieved both with trimepranol and chlorthalidone, whereas their combination was significantly more effective. 3. Trimepranol significantly antagonized the chlorthalidone-induced hypokalemia. 4. The results favor the use of diuretic or diuretic-beta-adrenoceptor blocker combination over beta-adrenoceptor blocker monotherapy in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.

Two patients with severe pleuropulmonary infection caused by non-sporing anaerobic bacteria are described. One had an empyema with foul-smelling pus and developed bacteraemia, and the other developed a lung abscess. Both were successfully treated with antibiotics and drainage, chest surgery being avoided. The successful diagnosis and treatment of these patients involved close liaison between clinical and laboratory staff.

A method for continuous measurement of scalp tissue pH is described. The tissue pH probe was found to be robust and values for tissue pH were close to those for scalp blood pH. Combining the pH and fetal heart fate (FHR) electrodes in the one mechanical assembly facilitated application to the fetal scalp in early labour but the combined assembly electrode was found to have some disadvantages and manufacture of a separate tissue PH electrode is recommended. Continuous monitoring of scalp tissue pH enables closer study of the physiological basis of changes in fetal acid base status and should prove useful to the obstetrician in management of high risk pregnancies during labour.

1. Amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) activity found in the intestinal tract of chicks posterior to the stomach is of endogenous origin, as amylase in the food is inactivated by the low pH in the stomachs. 2. Ingestion of raw soya-bean diet (RSD) or of heated soya-bean diet (HSD) supplemented with trypsin inhibitors induced higher amylase activites in the lower part of the small intestine and caecum as compared with HSD. 3. Ingestion of RSD after ligation at the end of the duodenum, end of the ileum or one of the cacea, or injection of soya-bean trypsin inhibitor into a aligated caecum, indicated that there is no amylase synthesis by the intestinal tract cells or microflora as a response to the presence of RSD or trypsin inhibitors. 4. It seems that amylase found in the digestive tract of the chick is of pancreatic origin and the RSD or trypsin inhibitors induce higher pancreatic amylase secretion than HSD which (the additiona amylase) accumulates mainly in the caeca.

To allow the detailed interpretation of the pH dependences of the steady-state parameters for the reaction catalyzed by triosephosphate isomerase, three kinds of experiments have been performed. First, the value of kcat/Km for enzyme-catalyzed isomerization of the phosphonate analogue of D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (2-hydroxy-4-phosphonobutyraldehyde) has been shown to titrate with an apparent pKa of 7.5, which is close to the phosphonate's second ionization constant. Secondly, the sulfate ester analogue of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dihydroxyacetone sulfate), which exists only as a monoanion over the pH range of interest, has been shown not to bind detectably to the enzyme. Thirdly, an isotopic discrimination experiment at pH 5.2 has been compared with a similar investigation at pH 7.6. The results together demonstrate that both enzyme and substrate ionizations control the reaction rate in the pH range 5 to 8.

The pH dependence of buffer catalysis of exchange of the C-4 amino protons of cyclic cytosine 2',3'-monophosphate (cCMP) and the N-1 proton of cyclic guanosine 2',3'-monophosphate (cGMP) conforms to an exchange mechanism, in which protonation of the nucleobases at C(N-3) AND G(N-7) establishes the important intermediates at neutral to acidic pH. Rate constants for transfer of the G(N-1) proton to H2O, OH-, phosphate, acetate, chloracetate, lactate, and cytosine (N-3) were obtained from 1H nuclear magnetic resonance line width measurements at 360 MHz and were used to estimate the pK or acidity of the exchange site in both the protonated and unprotonated nucleobase. These estimates reveal an increase in acidity of the G(N-1) site corresponding to 2 to 3 pK units as the G(N-7) site is protonated: At neutral pH the G(N-1) site of the protonated purine would be ionized (pK = 6.3). Determinations of phosphate, imidazole, and methylimidazole rate constants for transfer of the amino protons of cCMP provide a more approximate estimate of pK = 7 to 9 for the amino of the protonated pyrimidine. A comparison of the intrinsic amino acidity in the neutral and protonated cytosine is vitiated by the observation that OH- catalyzed exchange in the neutral base is not diffusion limited. This leads to the conclusion that protonation of the nucleobase effects a qualitative increase in the ability of the amino protons to form hydrogen bonds: from very poor in the neutral base to "normal" in the conjugate acid.

It is well known that alpha-chymotrypsin can exist in two major conformational states, only one of which is active. We have examined the pH (pH 2.0--11.0) and salt (ionic strength 0.01--1.0) dependence of the transition between the active and inactive forms in detail. At low pH (pH 2.0--6.0) the equilibrium is very dependent on salt concentration, with high salt concentrations effectively stabilizing the active conformation. This apparent stabilization is an artifact due to the salt-dependent dimerization of alpha-chymotrypsin, and our data show that only active species form dimers and higher aggregates. At neutral pH (6.0--8.0) dimerization is absent, yet an ionic strength dependence remains. The effects show no lyotropic order and appear to be due to preferential salt binding to the active conformation at one or possibly a few sites. Above pH 6 (pH 6.0--11.0), the pH dependence can be described by a two-ionization mechanism at all ionic strengths. We report values for all seven equilibrium constants in the proposed mechanism at four ionic strengths (mu = 0.01, 0.05, 0.2, and 1.0). The transition is the first "refolding" transition to be studied at high precision, but, even so, certain decisions about the mechanism must await higher experimental precision not available with present methods.

The 35Cl nuclear magnetic quadrupole relaxation enhancement on binding of chloride ions to human plasma albumin (HPA) has been studied under conditions of variable temperature, pH, ionic strength, protein, and sodium dodecyl sulfate concentration. A small number (less than 10) of chloride ions, most of which are bound to the primary detergent binding sites, contribute a major portion of the relaxation enhancement (greater than 80% at neutral pH). A comparison of the pH dependence of the relaxation rate with the hydrogen ion titration curve, which was determined and analyzed, identified ten lysyl and arginyl residues as being involved in the chloride ion binding. These data, in conjuction with NaDodSO4 titrations at different pH values and the amino acid sequence of HPA, suggests that the high-affinity chloride-binding sites are doubly cationic at neutral pH. An irreversible dimerization at acidic pH and 5 x 10(-5) m HPA was detected. The data also indicate the presence of internal modes of motion in the expanded forms of the HPA molecule, probably an independent reorientation of domains. The rate of exchange of chloride ions was shown to be much higher than the corresponding intrinsic relaxation rate in the temperature range 2--26 degrees C and pH values ranging from 4.0 to 10.5. No indications of protein-protein interaction could be found up to the physiological concentration of ca. 6 x 10(-4)m HPA at either neutral or alkaline pH. The mechanistic basis for HPA's exceptional capacity for binding of inorganic anions was discussed.

Spin-labeled secondary amines have been used to measure transmembrane proton gradients in sonicated liposomes. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of these probes show changes in the ratio of membrane associated to free aqueous probe as a function of transmembrane pH gradient. As the pH gradient is increased, inside acidic, the amount of membrane associated probe increases. The results are accounted for by a simple thermodynamic theory.

Using an improved spectrophotometer, we have reinvestigated the report (Hersey, S.J. (1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 344, 157--203) that acidification of the mucosal surface of frog gastric mucosa produces a crossover point between flavoprotein and cytochrome b, thus identifying a site of energy coupling between the cytochrome and H+ transport systems. While we find spectrophotometric changes upon addition of HCl to the mucosal solution, we find similar changes upon addition of NaCl without pH change, but no changes when the pH is lowered by substitution of H+ for Na+ at constant osmolality. We show that osmolality changes, with consequent alteration in tissue light scattering, are responsible for these effects. Further, we can show that the pH changes used do not inhibit acid secretion, and that one cannot do so without osmolality increase. We conclude that the imputed crossover point is not demonstrated, and that models based on its existence must be revised.

(1) The thermotropic behaviour of dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylcholine was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and freeze-fracture electron microscopy as a function of pH and of Ca2+ concentration. (2) From the thermotropic behaviour as a function of pH, profiles could be constructed from which apparent pK values of the charged groups of the lipids could be determined. (3) Excess Ca2+ induced a shift of the total phase transition in 14 : 0/14 : 0-glycerophosphocholine and 14 : 0/14 : 0-glycerophosphoglycerol mixtures. In 14 : 0/14 : 0-glycerophosphocholine bilayers containing 16 : 0/16 : 0-glycerophosphoglycerol lateral phase separation was induced by Ca2+. (4) Up to molar ratios of 1 : 2 of 14 : 0/14 : 0-glycerophosphoserine to 14 : 0/14: 0-glycerophosphocholine, excess Ca2+ induced lateral phase separation. Addition to mixtures of higher molar ratios caused segregation into different structures: the liposome organization and the stacked lamellae/cylindrical organization. (5) Addition of excess Ca2+ to mixtures of 14 : 0/14 : 0-glycerophosphocholine and 14 : 0/14 : 0-phosphatidic acid caused, independent of the molar ratio, separation into two structural different organizations. (6) The nature of Ca2+-induced changes in bilayers containing negatively charged phospholipids is strongly dependent on the character of the polar headgroup of the negatively charged phospholipid involved.

Lipase activity towards triacylglycerol and diacylglycerol was measured at pH 4.8 using a microsomal preparation from rat brain as the enzyme source. The optimal pH for the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol was 4.8, with only minor lipolytic activity in the alkaline pH range. Diacylglycerol was the major product of triacylglycerol hydrolysis, with only little monoacylglycerol being formed. When diacylglycerol was the starting substrate it was hydrolyzed at a rate 10-fold greater than triacylglycerol, and the product was monoacylglycerol. The enzyme showed positional specificity for the fatty acid moieties located at the primary positions of sn-glycerol. 1,3-Diacylglycerol was hydrolyzed at greater than twice the rate of the corresponding 1,2(2,3)-isomer.

The kinetics of dissociation of Zn2+ from the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase was measured over a range of pH, temperature, and acetate concentration. The rate of dissociation is extremely slow at neutral pH (t1/2 approximately 3) years, 4 degrees C), but increases in almost direct proportion to the hydrogen ion concentration and is enhanced in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline or acetate. The thermodynamic stability of the zinc-apoenzyme complex was determined over a range of pH from rate data on binding and dissociation (stability constants 10(9)-10(11) M-1, 25 degrees C). The great stability of the complex and slow exchange of the apoenzyme ligand is attributed, at least in part, to the rigidity of the multidentate protein ligand.

Effects of various compounds on Mg-dependent ATPase activity of chloroplast coupling factor--CF1--were studied. It was shown that the stimulating effect of compounds is increased with the increase in their hydrophobicity. Under given experimental conditions all compounds under study readily accept and donate protons. The maximal efficiency is reached when pH of the medium is close to the pK value of conjugated acid. It is assumed that the stimulating effects of compounds on Mg-dependent chloroplast ATPase consist in the increase of the rate of the limiting step of enzyme induced proton translocation coupled to the catalytic step of ATP hydrolysis.

Aminopeptidase A, which specifically hydrolyses N-terminal dicarbonic amino acid residues containing free alpha-amino groups, is isolated from bovine kidney. The enzyme is 500-fold purified and is homogenous under electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Aminopeptidase A has pH optimum of 7.5, it is activated with Ca2+ and inactivated with EDTA. Its molecular weight is 53000. The enzyme hydrolyses alpha-L-aspartyl-beta-naphtylamide and splits peptides having N-terminal glycine, lysine, arginine and alanine are hydrolyzed by the enzyme much slower. Aminopeptidase A does not attack alpha-L-alanyl-beta-naphtylamide, leucineamide, insulin, peptides with blocked N-terminal amino acid and peptides which have proline to be the second N-terminal amino acid.

Effect of chemical modification of horseradish peroxidase lysine epsilon-amino groups by propionic, butyric, valeric, succinic anhydrides and trinitrobenzolsulfonic acid (TNBS) on catalytic properties of the enzyme is investigated. All the preparations of modified peroxidase have 100% peroxidase activity for o-dianizidine at pH 7.0, which indicates the absence of lysine epsilon-amino group in the enzyme active site. pH-dependencies of modified peroxidase relative activity are studied; modification by anhydrides of monobasic acids is not found to result in changes of the relative activity pH-profile, while modification by succinic anhydride widens it. Absorption and circular dichoism spectra of native and modified peroxidase within 260--270 nm are obtained, some changes in the enzyme tertiary structure after its epsilon-amino groups modification are observed. Modification of four epsilon-amino groups by buturic and succinic anhydrides and of three epsilon-amino groups by TNBS is found to increase the regidity of protein surrounding of heme, and modification of six epsilon-amino groups by TNBS results in more unwrapped enzyme structure as compared with its native molecule.

Rabbit antibodies to rat skeletal muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, as well as monovalent Fab fragments of these antibodies were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Rat skeletal muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was then immobilized on a matrix by non-covalent binding to specific antibodies. Immobilized enzyme retains approximately 90% catalytic activity of the soluble dehydrogenase; pH optimum of activity and the Km value observed are changed as compared to the enzyme in solution. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase immobilized on specific antibodies is shown to undergo adenine nucleotide-induced dissociation into dimers. The immobilized dimeric form of the enzyme thus obtained is catalytically active and capable of reassociating with the dimers of apoglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase added in solution to the suspension of Sepharose.

Glucose-isomerizing enzyme was isolated from the culture of Actinomyces olivocinereus. It was purified by the chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The samples of glucose-isomerasing enzyme are homogeneous according to the results of analytical electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Glucose-isomerase is more stable than soluble one. The pH-optima of soluble and immobilized enzymes are 8.5 and 7.5, respectively. The temperature optimum of immobilized enzyme, Km, V, and activation energy do not change during immobilization. The immobilized sample has 58% activity of soluble enzyme.

Dependency of optical rotation of di- and triphosphoinositide water solutions on pH is investigated. The inversion of myo-inosite ring in triphosphoinositide molecule is found to take place at pH range corresponding to the transition of phosphomonoesters from monoanionic into dianionic form. Stabilization of optical rotation is observed at pH range, where one monoester phosphate group is in monoanionic form and the other--in dianionic form. Probably, triphosphoinositide is in the conformation (distorted boat) at this pH range. Diphosphoinositide does not change its optical rotation under pH changes of water or organic solutions. A contribution is estimated of free conformational energy into standard free energy of splitting triphosphoinositide phosphate group depending on pH value. It is concluded that low energy phosphate bond becomes high energy bond due to the free electrostatic interaction of dianionic phosphate group with other negatively charged group in sin-clynal conformation.

Adsorption spectra of Hb+ and HbO2 adsorbed on silica and monolayers cholesterol supported on silica have been studied. It is shown that immobilization leads to new states of proteins, their properties depending on the nature of support and conditions of adsorption. Adsorption of haemoglobin leads to its inactivation. The rate of inactivation decreases with an increase of surface concentration of haemoglobin and with simultaneous adsorption of inert proteins.

1-, 4-, 14- and 28-day-old rats were exposed to a hypoxic environment of 5.9, 8.0 or 12.0% O2 during a period of 30 min. In the brain, tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase activity was studied in vivo by measuring the accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), respectively, after inhibition of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase with NSD 1015. Tyrosine and tryptophan levels in the brain were measured simultaneously. The brain tyrosine and tryptophan levels were generally not influenced either by age or hypoxic levels. Tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase activity decreased to about the same extent during the various hypoxic levels at all ages studied. It is concluded that the first, rate-limiting, step in the synthesis of the monoamine neurotransmittors dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HT) is affected during moderate as well as severe hypoxia at all stages of development.

The spleen cells transfer from mice CBA at the 25th day of the carcinogenesis latent period induced by adenovirus SA7(S8) to newborn syngeneic animals caused the graft versus host reaction in them. There was splenomegaly and progressive decrease in weight of the recipients' thymus. Analogous alterations of lymphoid organs were noted in the animals infected during the neonatal period by oncogenic adenovirus SA7(C8). Results showed that adenoviral carcinogenesis had some manifestations of autoimmune disease.

Sulphasalazine is a potent and selective inhibitor in vitro of prostaglandin 15-hydroxydehydrogenase in rabbit colon (ID50 = 50 micrometer) and in several other organs of different species, but does not inhibit prostaglandin delta-13 reductase or microsomal prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid. It is suggested that this action may underly the therapeutic usefulness of sulphasalazine in ulcerative colitis for the prevention of relapse.

1 The pharmacological characteristics of adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic action in the dog heart were assessed by the use of blood-perfused papillary muscles and isolated strips of ventricular myocardium.2 On the blood-perfused papillary muscle driven at 2 Hz and in sinus node preparations, phenylephrine induced positive inotropic and chronotropic responses in the same dose range and was much less potent than isoprenaline. The dose-response curve for the chronotropic action of phenylephrine was parallel to that of isoprenaline, whilst the dose-response curve for the inotropic action of phenylephrine was less steep than that of isoprenaline.3 The infusion of pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, at a rate of 1 mug/min, shifted the isoprenaline dose-response curves to the right, and to the same extent, in both papillary muscle and sinus node preparations. In contrast to isoprenaline, the antagonism of phenylephrine by pindolol was noncompetitive. Phentolamine did not affect the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of phenylephrine.4 On isolated ventricular strips alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by 10(-6) M phentolamine did not affect dose-response curves to phenylephrine or dopamine. Pindolol shifted the dopamine dose-response curves to the right in a competitive manner and those of phenylephrine in a noncompetitive manner.5 On ventricular strips from reserpine-pretreated dogs phenylephrine and tyramine dose-response curves were shifted markedly to the right and downwards. Desipramine (10(-5) M) which enhanced the action of noradrenaline considerably reduced the myocardial responses of phenylephrine.6 Papaverine (10(-5) M) decreased the threshold concentration of phenylephrine required to stimulate the myocardium and shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the left.7 Raising the temperature from 32 degrees C to 37 degrees C shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the right; when the temperature was raised from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C the affinity of the drug was not changed.8 Other alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants, methoxamine and clonidine, decreased the active tension of ventricular strips. The responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline (in the presence of pindolol; 3 x 10(-8) M) were not affected by phentolamine (10(-6) M).9 The results indicate that adrenoceptors mediating positive inotropic responses in the dog ventricle are of the beta-type and that post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors are not involved. Phenylephrine acts mainly by releasing noradrenaline from adrenergic nerve endings and partly by a weak direct action on beta-adrenoceptors.

1 The effects of various narcotic analgesics on the uptake and release of labelled 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in brain and spinal cord synaptosomes were investigated.2 Methadone was most active in inhibiting 5-HT uptake (IC(50) 2.5 x 10(-7) M). Levorphanol also inhibited 5-HT uptake to a large extent (IC(50) 8.8 x 10(-7) M) while dextrophan, pethidine and pentazocine showed much less activity. Etorphine and morphine had virtually no such activity, with IC(50)S higher than 10(-4) and 10(-3) M respectively.3 The same order of potency as ;5-HT releasers' was found when radioactivity was measured in [(3)H]-5-HT preloaded synaptosomal pellets incubated for 20 min with the various narcotics. Methadone, like chlorimipramine, showed a significant effect at a concentration of 10(-7) M while morphine, at a concentration of 10(-4) M, had no effect.4 When 5-HT release was studied by a perfusion technique, which largely prevents reuptake of the released amine, only fenfluramine, an anorectic agent proposed as a 5-HT releaser, significantly increased spontaneous 5-HT release. These data suggest that the apparent 5-HT release induced by various narcotics in traditional incubation techniques may largely depend on their ability to interfere with neurotransmitter reuptake mechanisms.5 The effects of the various narcotics on 5-HT uptake have no relationship to their relative potency as analgesics in the rat. In the light of their poor effectiveness as 5-HT releasers, it can be concluded that mechanisms other than 5-HT uptake inhibition and release are probably involved in the analgesic effects of these compounds in intact animals.

The localization of cholinergic, aminergic and amino acid-ergic neurones in the mediobasal hypothalamus has been studied in normal rat brain and in brains where neurones in nucleus arcuatus were destroyed by repeated administration of 2 mg/g body weight monosodium glutamate to newborn animals. In normal animals acetylcholinesterase staining, choline acetyltransferase and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase were concentrated in the median eminence and the arcuate nucleus. Glutamate decarboxylase was concentrated at the boundary between the ventromedial and the arcuate nuclei, with lower activity in the arcuate nucleus and very low activity in the median eminence. Nucleus arcuatus contained an intermediate level of high affinity glutamate uptake. In the lesioned animals, there were significant decreases in choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase staining and glutamate decarboxylase in the median eminence, whereas choline acetyltransferase activity and acetylcholinesterase staining, but not glutamate decarboxylase activity, were decreased in nucleus arcuatus. Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase was unchanged in all regions studied. The high affinity uptakes of glutamate, dopamine and noradrenaline, and the endogenous amino acid levels were also unchanged in the treated animals. The results indicate the existence of acetylcholine- and GABA-containing elements in the tuberoinfundibular tract. They further indicate that the dopamine cells in the arcuate nucleus are less sensitive to the toxic effect of glutamate than other cell types, possibly because they contain less glutamate receptors.

The superior cervical ganglion (SCG) of the guinea pig has been investigated by a multidisciplinary approach. Dopamine (50 micron) produced no increase in cyclic AMP levels above control values of 27.9 pmole/mg protein, but 50 micron isoproterenol produced cyclic AMP levels of 210 pmole/mg protein, indicating the existence of a beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex. The SIF cells were studied by fluorescence histochemistry, which indicated that two morphological types were present. A few Type I cells of the guinea pig SCG were solitary, but most were present in clusters containing many Type II cells. Immunohistochemical localization of antibodies to dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) demonstrated that types of SIF cell localize antibodies to DBH but not PNMT, providing strong evidence that norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter for all the SIF cells of the guinea pig SCG. Determination of the ratio of norepinephrine to dopamine confirmed that no other dopamine pools exist in the guinea pig SCG.

Evidence is presented that post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) of the cholinergic, fast, Cl- dependent IPSP seen in cell L5 of the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia californica upon eliciting a spoke in cell L10 is due to an increase in spike-evoked transmitter release. The magnitude of the post-tetanic change in spike-evoked release is inversely correlated with the amount of transmitter released by an isolated presynaptic spike. This was found whether the latter was increased by injection of tetraethyl ammonium (TEA) into the soma of L10 or decreased by hyperpolarization of the soma of L10. Neither of these manipulations affected the rate of decay of PTP. The magnitude of PTP was increased and the rate of decay reduced by increasing either the number or frequency of stimuli in the tetanus. Under all conditions PTP decayed with a single exponential time course, asymptotically approaching the unpotentiated magnitude. It is concluded that while both the amplitude and rate of decay of PTP are affected by the frequency and number of stimuli in the tetanus, the underlying mechanism controlling the amplitude of PTP is different from the mechanism controlling the rate of decay of PTP.

The carcinogen N-hydroxy-1-naphthylamine reacted with nucleic acids and protein under slightly acidic conditions (pH 5) to form covalently bound derivatives with 3 to 20 naphthyl residues/1000 monomer units. The level of binding was in the following order: DNA greater than polyguanylic acid greater than denatured DNA and ribosomal RNA greater than serum albumin greater than transfer RNA greater than polyadenylic acid. Reactions with nucleosides and nucleotides were not detected, and the binding of N-hydroxy-1-naphthylamine to DNA was not inhibited by the addition of nucleosides, nucleotides, methionine, or glutathione. The reaction rates were first order with respect to both DNA and N-hydroxy-1-naphthylamine concentrations. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the DNA containing naphthyl residues yielded 3 nucleoside-arylamine adducts. The major adduct was identified by chemical, ultraviolet, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometric analyses as N-(deoxyguanosin-O6-yl)-1-naphthylamine. The other two adducts were identified as 2-(deoxyguanosin-O6-yl)-1-naphthylamine and its decomposition product. Direct evidence for acid-dependent arylnitrenium ion formation was obtained by isotope exchange upon solvolysis of N-hydroxy-1-naphthylamine in acidic H2 18O, and carbocation formation was indicated by the formation of the solvolysis products, 1-amino-2-naphthol and 1-amino-4-naphthol. These studies demonstrated the conversion of a carcinogenic N-hydroxy arylamine to electrophilic arylnitrenium ion and carbocation species that display high selectivity toward macromolecules. The roles of these electrophiles and their macromolecular adducts in the initiation of urinary bladder carcinogenesis through formation of promutagenic lesions in DNA are suggested.

Isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel combined with limited proteolysis is a simple and specific method for quantitation of estradiol receptors in breast cancer tissue. At least eight different samples can be analyzed simultaneously on one gel, and the whole procedure, including sample preparation, takes less than 7 hr. In comparison with sucrose gradient centrifugation, isoelectric focusing is more sensitive, possibly due to the short time (1.5 to 2 hr) needed for the analysis. Furthermore, only one incubation with tritium-labeled estradiol is needed for an analysis, which means that a smaller amount of tumor tissue is needed than for most other methods. This fact allows analysis of the estrogen receptor content in tumor material obtained from fine-needle biopsy.

The axial skeletal rod of Veretillium cynomorium consists of a fibrillar collagenous matrix calcified with calcite. The present paper describes ultrastructural and crystallographic details of its organization and deposition. At the inferior end of the rod is a calcification gradient between the noncalcified tip and the rest of the axis. Initial mineral deposits, which are sometimes associated with cell debris, give rise to calcitic nodules which enlarge by the radical growth of several lobes. These nodules fuse and form the core of the axis. Subsequent increase in diameter of the rod involves the radial development of irregular columns of calcite which arise from the peripheral nodules. Mineral surfaces exhibit a distinctive microarchitecture which can be related to the predominantly c-axis parallel growth of the calcite. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between mineral and matrix. The collagen fibrils, embedded in the calcite but never impregnated with it, are not responsible for the initial nucleation of mineral. The crystallographic orientation of the calcite also appears to be independent of these fibrils.

We have showed induction of tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase in hepatic cytosol of Rats (Wistar strain) five hours after intraperitoneal administration of tricyclic compounds (phenothiazine, iminodibenzyl, thioxanthene, thiophenylpyridylamin, dibenzocycloheptadiene, dibenzoxepin derivatives). Chemical structure of these molecules is very important: sulfur atom (phenothiazine, thioxanthene), some substituants like chlorine (chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene) and 2'-dimethylaminopropyl chain (promethazine) increase this inductive effect.

These drugs, except centrophenoxine, inhibit in vitro in a competitive manner, norepinephrin uptake in Rat hypothalamus and cortex, and dopamine uptake in corpus striatum and cortex, at higher concentrations than d.l. amphetamine; this alone inhibits serotonin uptake in hypothalamus.

Increase of hepatic tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase is observed in Rats (Wistar strain) after intraperitoneal administration of tricyclic compounds (phenothiazin and related structure derivatives). This is an induction process: actinomycine D inhibits this effect. This action is not mediated by glucocorticoids: induction persists in adrenalectomized Rats. The mechanism of action is different too: additive effects are found after simultaneous injection of glucocorticoid and tricyclic drug.

We report the kinetics of the reactions of unconjugated bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin with p-diazobenzene sulfonic acid in aqueous media. Our studies confirm that each reaction proceeds in two steps and that the second step is catalyzed by sulfanilic acid. In the presence of an excess of p-diazobenzenesulfonic acid and in the absence of sulfanilic acid, the reaction for either unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin proceeds in two successive first-order steps, the second step being much the slower. This study emphasizes the first step in the reaction for each species and includes data on the effects of p-diazobenzenesulfonic acid, albumin, benzoate, and caffeine concentrations, pH in the range from 4 to 12, and temperature. Mechanisms proposed for reactions with and without caffeine are used to develop rate equations, and the kinetic data are used to evaluate rate constants, acid dissociation constants for the different bilirubin species, and formation constants for bilirubin-caffeine complex species that are proposed.

This paper describes a fast kinetic method for the simultaneous determination of unconjugated and conjugated bilirugin in the same reaction solution. A stopped-flow mixing system with a stabilized photometer and small computer is used to mix sample and reagent rapidly and to record 250 data points during a 700-ms reaction time, and a regression program is used to resolve these kinetic data into the concentrations of unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin. Data are reported for synthetic single and two-component samples and for serum samples. Kinetic results for synthetic mixtures and serum samples are compared with results obtained by a conventional two-step procedure. Regression equations show good linearity between kinetically determined absorbance changes and concentration, good agreement between taken and found values for total, unconjugated, and conjugated bilirubin for synthetic samples in human serum albumin, and a good correlation between kinetic and equilibrium results for these species in sera. Regression slopes for kinetic vs. equilibrium assay results for total, unconjugated, and conjugated bilirubins in sera were 1.01 +/- 0.05, 1.04 +/- 0.03 and 0.91 +/- 0.04, respectively, with intercepts of 6.6,--2.7, and 3.8 micromol/liter, and standard errors of estimate of 28, 14, and 20 micromol/liter. These data reflect uncertainties in both the kinetic and equilibrium methods.

We describe a column-chromatographic method for separating the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isoenzymes of aspartate aminotransferase in human serum. Bed height of the ion exchanger, pH, and salt concentrations in the eluting buffers are shown to be variables affecting the separation of the isoenzymes. Under the optimized conditions selected for this study, a 30% increase in volume was observed in one fraction, associated with changing the salt concentration of the eluting buffer and attributed to a contraction of the DEAE-Sephadex A-50. Elution profiles (enzyme activity vs. fraction number) were examined with highly purified mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isoenzymes of human origin in bovine serum albumin and human serum. Recovery of the enzyme in the eluted fractions averaged 102% (SD, 2.0%) for specimens prepared from the purified isoenzymes and 104% (SD, 10.7%) for 38 human serum specimens. The separation technique showed linearity to catalytic concentrations in excess of 200 U/liter (reaction temperature 30 degrees C) for each isoenzyme. Additional information is presented regarding among-day precision and the effect of specimen dilution.

The principal enzyme of human prostatic acid phosphatase [orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase (acid optimum), EC 3.1.3.2], which had been highly purified by affinity chromatography, isoelectric focusing, and gel filtrations, was shown to be homogeneous at pH 5.0 by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. The amino acid composition was determined and the sedimentation coefficient of the native molecule measured. The relative molecular mass was 89,000 at pH 5.0, as measured by analytical ultracentrifugation. The Km-value of the enzyme for p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate is 1.8-10(-4) mol/liter. I also examined substrate speificity, different inhibitors, and the effects of pH, temperature, and serum on the enzyme activity.

Investigations into the choice of immunogen, ligand, antiserum and assay conditions for the radioimmunoassay of conjugated cholic acid have been performed with a view to producing optimal assay conditions. Cholic acid-BSA was found to be the best immunogen to produce antibodies to conjugated cholic acid and the response was of an IgG type. Incorporating a spacer (hexanoic acid) between hapten and carrier protein resulted in a decrease in antiserum titre. Optimal conditions for the assay were found using [125I]histamine-glycocholic acid as ligand with a dilution of antiserum to produce 60% binding of ligand and a pH of 7.4. Using these assay conditions no serum effects were found; extraction of serum prior to assay was therefore unnecessary. The assay was sensitive enough to detect post-prandial increased in serum bile acid concentrations following a liquid test meal; no increase was observed throughout the same time period in a fasting control.

The "oxytocinase" activity has been determined as the CAP (cystyl-aminopeptidase, EC 3.4.11.3) activity with several substrates. It was demonstrated that serum samples from pregnant women and patients with serious liver disease had increased CAP activities compared with normal serum. It was also shown that seminal plasma had very high CAP activity. The pH optimum for the enzymes from the various sources differed, as did the metal dependence. Furthermore, samples from patients with liver disease had higher CAP activities when assayed in buffers containing amino groups, in contrast to the other samples. Gel chromatography and gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of several isoenzymes. The serum from pregnant women contained an isoenzyme neither present in normal plasma nor in any of the other sources tested. It is possible that this isoenzymes represents the true oxytocinase. CAP and LAP (leucine aminopeptidase) activities were very well correlated in serum from pregnant women and seminal plasma, while the correlation for samples from patients with liver disease was not as good. When care was taken to determine the CAP activity at the right pH and with the appropriate buffer, the risk for interference from other enzymes was minimized in the determination of oxytocinase as CAP activity.

The activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase was studied in guinea pig after bile duct ligation. In serum, an abrupt increase in activity up to 10--20 times the normal value was found 3 h after obstruction and the mean activity over the first 3 days following the operation was some 8 times the normal value. In liver, however, a small decline in activity could be demonstrated. The administration of cycloheximide did not influence the acute increase in serum activity. Bile duct ligation caused marked increases in serum bile acid levels which initially paralleled the serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity. It is suggested that the increased serum activity may arise from the solubilization by bile acids of liver membrane-bound enzyme.

Cadmium can be isolated from plasma by formation of negative charged iodide complexes bound to an anion exchange resin. Elution from the resin gives a cadmium solution with only a few interfering substances in an uniform matrix. Thus an undisturbed determination by flameless atomic absorption spectrometry is achieved. The mean of the natural cadmium level found in plasma was 1.9 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, within the normal range between 1.1 and 3.3 ng/ml.

Neutral beta-galactosidase was partially purified from liver of normal controls, a patient with Niemann-Pick disease type A and the previously described patient with lactosyl ceramidosis using Concanavalin A-Sepharose adsorption and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. The partially purified fractions were essentially free of galactosyl ceramide beta-galactosidase and GM1 beta-galactosidase activities. The normal and Niemann-Pick fractions were found to hydrolyze lactosyl ceramide, in the presence of sodium taurodeoxycholate, at a pH optimum of 5.6 as well as aryl beta-galactosides and aryl beta-glucosides at pH 6.2. The corresponding fraction from the lactosyl ceramidosis liver contained only 1--4% of the normal activity towards artificial substrates and lactosyl ceramide. Cross-reacting material identical to the normal was demonstrated in this fraction with antiserum raised against purified neutral beta-galactosidase, but no activity was observed in the precipitin line when stained with naphthol AS-LC-beta-galactoside or naphthol AS-LC-beta-glucoside. A similar deficiency of neutral beta-galactosidase activity was demonstrated in cultivated fibroblasts of the patient with lactosyl ceramidosis. Following adsorption on Concanavalin A-Sepharose and anti-GM1 beta-galactosidase antibody-Sepharose conjugates and chromatography on DEAE cellulose, fibroblast lysates from the patient exhibited 3% of normal activity towards 4-methyl-umbelliferyl beta-glucoside at pH 6.2 and 12% of normal activity towards lactosyl ceramide at pH 5.6. These data suggest that neutral beta-galactosidase may have an in vivo role in the cleavage of lactosyl ceramide and that a deficiency of this activity may be related to the lactosyl ceramide accumulation observed in the patient with lactosyl ceramidosis.

A brief, simple and unexpensive UV spectrophotometric method for theophylline serum level determination is described. Charcoal extraction was performed for theophylline isolation from biological fluids. Coefficients of variation and recovery are similar to other parallel methods.

The role of calcium as an intracellular messenger in the activation of eukaryotic cells is discussed. Particular emphasis is devoted to: (1) the interrelationship between cell activation by chemical stimuli and alterations in intracellular calcium metabolism, and (2) the interrelated roles of calcium and the cyclic nucleotides, cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, in achieving the final integrated, co-ordinated cellular response.

Levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma or tissue from thirty-five patients with watery diarrhoea, and in plasma of twenty-five normal controls. Plasma levels were between 0.6 and 11.0 ng/ml in thirty-one of the thirty-three patients in whom it was measured and too low to measure (less than 200 pg/ml) in the other two. Peptide levels were less than 200 pg/ml in twenty-three of the controls, but higher in the remaining two. All tissues from patients were "rich" in VIP (10 ng to 35 microgram per g). The aetiologic diagnoses included pancreatic islet-cell adenoma or adenocarcinoma, islet-cell hyperplasia, bronchogenic carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and retroperitoneal histiocytoma. The findings support the conclusions that: (1) VIP is a likely mediator of the water-diarrhoea syndrome; (2) the syndrome may result from a variety of tumours; (3) this or a related peptide hormone may be secreted by these tumours; and (4) these tumours may have a common embryonic origin.

In the Vertebrata the great majority of cells producing hormonal peptides belong to the APUD series and share its distinctive cytochemical and ultrastructural characteristics. According to the concept all members of the series are to be regarded as derivatives of neuroectoderm or of specialized (placodal) ectoderm. For most of the APUD cells this criterion is fulfilled in that their origin from neural tube, neural ridges or neural crest can be considered proven. Complete proof is not yet available for the APUD cells of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, and indeed much contrary evidence can be cited. Despite the latter, our embryological studies show: (1) that the hypothalamohypophyseal complex is wholly neuroectodermal; (2)that the chronology of neural crest dispersion is such that this tissue could be responsible for observed APUD cell contributions to the foregut; (3) that placodal ectoderm makes important contributions to pharyngeal pouch endocrine derivatives in birds and mammals; and (4) that the amphibian parathyroid gland is derived from the same layer of neural ectoderm as the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis. Supporting immunocytochemical studies indicate that peptides belonging to the APUD series are more widely distributed than hitherto recognized and it is concluded: (1) that the whole of peptide endocrinology is neuroendocrinology; and (2) that the APUD cells, with a few cells hitherto regarded as being outside the series, form a third (Endocrine) division of the nervous system to add to the existing Somatic and Autonomic divisions.

After four decades of intense and competitive research, three hypothalamic releasing hormones (formerly factors) have recently been isolated and characterized. These are the decapeptide gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), tripeptide thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH), and the tetradecapeptide somatostatin. Some aspects of these hormones are discussed, and GnRH is considered in greater detail to demonstrate the difficulties involved in fulfilling completely the criteria which determine whether a substance can be accepted as a physiological releasing hormone. A substance immunologically similar to GnRH is present in rat hypophysial portal vessel blood, but, while the amount of this substance released into the portal circulation can be increased significantly by electrical stimulation of the preoptic area, no significant changes occur during the oestrous cycle or after long-term castration. This may be due to interference with the normal secretion of GnRH by the trauma and anaesthesia which necessarily accompany exposure of the pituitary stalk. However, the possibility exists that our preconceived notions regarding the changes in plasma levels of releasing hormones under physiological conditions may be incorrect. Thus it seems likely that changes in the rate of secretion of thyrotrophin is effected by throid hormones modulating the responsiveness of the thyrotrophs to a steady input of TRH. Evidence is presented for the existence of a similar mechanism for gonadotrophin secretion, and the role of steroid hormones and the priming effect of GnRH in modulating the responsiveness of the gonadotrophs is considered. The intrinsic connexions of the hypothalamus, the role of the hypothalamic aminergic systems and the autonomy of the hypothalamus with respect to anterior pituitary control present many problems which will prove difficult to solve.

To elucidate the relative role of osmolar (sodium) and acetate shifts during dialysis, 6 patients with problems of overhydration underwent rapid ultrafiltration for 1 hr (mean weight reduction 2.0 kg), using the 1 m2 RP 6 dialyzer. Ultrafiltration was carried out at the beginning of each of 5 dialysis treatments at weekly intervals. Ultrafiltration was undertaken without dialysis (controls) and with simultaneous dialysis using acetate (40 mmoles/1) or bicarbonate (25 mmoles/1) in the dialysis fluid with dialyzate sodium concentration of 133 and 145 mmoles/1. The systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure which were stable with ultrafiltration only fell slightly when a high dialyzate sodium concentration was used and much further when the dialyzate sodium concentration was kept low. These changes were apparently related to the changes in plasma osmolality. Acetate had no effect on blood pressure at the higher sodium concentration, but a slight (insignificant) additive effect when used in the low-sodium dialyzate. Shifts in osmolality (sodium concentration) seem to be more important than the effect of acetate in inducing dialysis-associated hypotension.

It is possible to predict plasma concentrations of drugs by measurement in saliva, obviating the need for venipuncture. Using a selection of weakly acidic and basic drugs, we have found this prediction reliable for drugs largely nonionized at normal plasma pH (phenytoin, phenobarbital, antipyrine) but unreliable for ionized drugs (chlorpropramide, tolbutamide, propranolol, meperidine). Deliberate alteration of saliva flow rate and pH using different stimuli have produced twofold changes in saliva drug concentrations. Wide interindividual variability of saliva pH is the likely explanation for the inconstancy of saliva to plasma concentration ratios for ionized drugs.

The pharmacokinetic profile of (-)-2-hydroxy-N-cyclopropylmethylmorphinan (HCMM), a narcotic antagonist and analgesic, has been evaluated in man following administration of 25 to 50 mg of the drug orally and 10 to 15 mg intramuscularly. A specific radioimmunoassay procedure was developed for the determination of HCMM in plasma and urine. The drug had a mean "apparent" elimination half-life in plasma of about 11 hr following both routes of administration. A mean of 47% of the oral dose was excreted in the urine as unconjugated and conjugated HCMM and only 5% of the dose was excreted as intact HCMM. In one subject studied, the plasma levels of conjugated HCMM were as much as 5-fold higher than the levels of unconjugated drug. Although there was considerable intersubject variability following both routes of administration, the overall pharmacokinetic parameters suggest that oral and intramuscular doses are bioequivalent.

The disposition of chlordiazepoxide (50 mg, intravenously), diazepam (0.143 mg/kg, orally), and oxazepam (0.429 mg/kg, orally) were studied in normal and alcoholic men before and after chronic disulfiram administration. Decreases in the plasma clearance of chlordiazepoxide (54%, p less than 0.05), diazepam (41%, p less than 0.05), and their active N-desmethyl metabolites were observed. Oxazepam has no important active metabolites and its net disposition is minimally altered by disulfiram. Oxazepam disposition is unaffected by age and liver disease. These considerations together with that of the short half-life of oxazepam (median, 6.1 hr) suggest that oxazepam may be the drug of choice if benzodiazepine therapy is used for patients taking disulfiram.

1. Spiral strips of human digital arteries have been studied in vitro to investigate whether DL-propranolol, D-propranolol, oxprenolol and labetalol have peripheral vascular effects in man. 2. Labetalol was a potent inhibitor of contractile responses to noradrenaline, but had less effect on responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine and barium chloride. 3. DL-and D-propranolol were equally effective inhibitors of responses to barium chloride. They were only weak antagonists of noradrenaline responses, but stronger, non-competitive antagonists of 5-hydroxytryptamine responses. 4. Oxprenolol was only a weak inhibitor of the responses to both noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine and had little effect on responses to barium chloride. 5. It is concluded that labetalol has specific alpha-adrenoreceptor-blocking properties, which are probably relevant to its therapeutic action in man. Propranolol has non-specific inhibitory effect on vascular smooth muscle, which might contribute to its hypotensive activity at high concentrations, but oxprenolol has only slight peripheral effects that are probably therapeutically insignificant.

A 51-year-old woman with chronic respiratory failure (status after tuberculosis) was given an infusion of doxapram hydrochloride (1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight per hour) for four episodes of acute exacerbation of her condition. Treatment with the drug prevented worsening of hypercapnia in the four episodes, when administration of 24 percent oxygen had occasioned rises in the arterial carbon dioxide tension of 23, 10, 9, and 7 mm Hg.

1. Sulpiride, but not procainamide, antagonizes the excitatory effects of (+/-)-octopamine receptors in the Tapes ventricle. Neither compound attenuates dopamine excitation. 2. Clozapine will attenuate the effects of (+/-)-octopamine and (-)-alpha-methyl octopamine at the octopamine receptor but not the excitatory effect of dopamine at dopamine receptors. 3. Clozapine is more potent than its 2-positional isomer HF 2046 in attenuating octopamine excitation. However, HF 2046, unlike clozapine, will attenuate the excitatory effects of dopamine. 4. These data indicate that replacement of the 8-chloro substituent in the clozapine nucleus with a 2-chloro substituent decreases the ability of the compound to blockaed octopamine receptors. However, the 2-chloro-substituted compound (HF 2046) now has the added ability to blockade excitatory dopamine receptors. 5. The greater potency of clozapine than HF 2046 as an octopamine antagonist suggests that it is the 8-chloro-substituted aromatic ring of clozapine which overlaps the aromatic site usually occupied by the octopamine aromatic ring.

Scanning electron microscopic examination of tooth surfaces after using manually operated instruments to remove calculus showed distinct lesions on the hard substances of the tooth. The extent of damage depends considerably on the area of the tooth treated (the border between the enamel and the cementum is particularly endangered), the amount of force used, and the length of time required for treatment. Examination of tooth surfaces following application of various types of power-driven scaling instruments revealed that lesions of the hard substances on the tooth are possible. The extent of the damage depends on several different factors, particularly the pressure applied and the area of the tooth treated. The border between the enamel and the cementum is particulary endangered.

The author uses during demethylization in vitro two types of NADPH-generating systems: 1) postmitochondrial supernatant, whose disadvantage is that in vivo effects the cause for changes in demethylization could be due both to microsomes and dehydrogenases: 2) imported purified enzymic preparations, which is connected with supplying difficulties. The author proposes the usage of postmicrosomal supernatant (cytosol) from rats' liver to overcome these disadvantages. This fraction is with very good efficiency compared with that of the imported purified enzymes. The isolated cytosol, preserved at -10 degrees keeps its initial activity for a period of three days, but after or six days the diminition of the enzymic activity could be compensated by using simultaneously two substrates-isocytrate and glucose-6-phosphate for demethylizating systems.

Flunitrazepam or diazepam with atropine and a combination of phenoperidine, droperidol and cyclizine (neuroleptanalgesia) were compared as premedication in three groups of 25 patients undergoing routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Drug doses were titrated carefully against response and all three regimes were found to be similar in terms of safety, patient co-operation, relaxation and speed of recovery. Neuroleptanalgesia however produced a statistically significant rise in endtidal pCO2 and systolic blood pressure. The benzodiazepines, and in particular flunitrazepam, produced a significantly greater amnesia for the procedure, patients given these drugs being more willing to undergo repeat endoscopy.

Toxin I from Anemonia sulcata, a major component of the sea anemone venom, consists of 46 amino acid residues which are linked by three disulfide bridges. The [14C]carboxymethylated polypeptide was sequenced to position 29 by automated Edman degradation. The remaining sequence was determined from cyanogen bromide peptides and from tryptic peptides of the citraconylated [14C]carboxymethylated toxin. Toxin I is homologous to toxin II from Anemonia sulcata and to anthopleurin A, a toxin from the sea anemone Anthopleura xanthogrammica. These toxins constitute a new class of polypeptide toxins. No significant homologies exist with toxin III from Anemonia sulcata nor with known sequences of neurotoxins or cardiotoxins of various origin.

The operation of cytochrome c oxidase with ascorbate/N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine as substrate in antimycin-A-inhibited rat liver mitochondria is coupled to proton ejection. Measurements of the initial rate of valinomycin-dependent K+ uptake have shown that nearly 4 K+ are taken up as 2 electrons are transferred from cytochrome c to oxygen. This proves directly that a charge separation of nearly 4 occurs across the inner mitochondrial membrane each time 2 electrons are transferred to oxygen. Measurements of the initial rate of proton movement after addition of the reductant show that about 1.6 protons are released by the mitochondria as 2 electrons are transferred from cytochrome c to oxygen. The data support the suggestion of a proton pump coupled to the operation of cytochrome c oxidase [Wikström, M. F. K. (1977) Nature (Lond.) 266, 271--273].

Light-driven potassium ion uptake in Halobacterium halobium is mediated by bacteriorhodopsin. This uptake is charge-balanced by sodium ions and not by proton release. Light-induced shifts in concentrations of divalent cations were found to be negligible. The transient changes in extracellular pH (alkaline overshoot) can be understood by the concomitant processes of ATP synthesis, proton/sodium exchange and potassium uptake. The driving force of potassium ion uptake is the membrane potential, no ATP-dependent potassium transport process is found. Fluorescence measurements indicate a high permeability of the membrane to potassium ions compared to sodium ions. Therefore the potassium ion diffusion potential contributes to the membrane potential (about 30 mV/decade) and thereby influences the ATP level. Sudden enhancement of the diffusion potential by the potassium ionophore monactin leads to the expected transient increase in cellular ATP level. Due to the large size (up to 100-fold) of the potassium ion gradient and its high capacity (intracellular concentration up to 3 M) the potassium ion gradient can well serve the cell as a long term storage form of energy.

The glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) from the N2-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii was purified to homogeneity by heat treatment, ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. The following molecular parameters were determined: molecular weight 640 000, subunit molecular weight 53 000, partial specific volume 0.710 cm3/g, isoelectric point 4.6, amino acid composition. Most of the molecules are composed of 12 identical subunits but active oligomers of other degrees of polymerization, apparently aggregates with 8, 10 and 24 subunits, were also detected to a lesser extent. The enzymatic activity is regulated via adenylylation-deadenylylation cycles: liberation of AMP was detected upon treatment of the adenylylated form with phosphodiesterase along with a change in the catalytic properties. Adenylylation in vivo is specifically induced by high extracellular ammonia levels. The Km values for the Mg2+-dependent formation of glutamine were independent of the degree of adenylylation for glutamate and ATP, but varied for ammonia. Furthermore the catalytic activity is regulated by several nitrogenous feedback inhibitors. The degree of inhibition in some cases was dependent on the substrate concentrations: the sensitivity towards glycine, alanine and serine decreased with a decreasing ammonia level, while the sensitivity towards ADP or AMP increased with a decreasing ATP concentration. Part of the enzyme (about 30%) seems to be attached to the plasma membrane while the main fraction is found in the cytosol.

Halopemide is a new psychotropic agent, structurally related to the neuroleptics of the butyrophenone type, but with a different phamacological and clinical profile. The concentration of halopemide in the rat brain is about 10 times less than that of R29800, its chemical congener and of spiperone, both typical neuroleptics. In the pituitary gland, however, the levels are the same. The distribution profile of halopemide in rat brain deviates from that of neuroleptics. The highest level of halopemide is found in septal and thalamic areas whereas the neuroleptics are concentrated in the caudate nucleus, the nucleus accumbens and the tuberculum olfactorium. Subcellular distribution experiments show that in the caudate nucleus halopemide is far less particle-bound that are the neuroleptic agents.

The effects of 6 benzamides and 8 classical neuroleptics were studied on 6 different apomorphine-induced effects. These drugs did not antagonize all the effects in the same way. The differences are discussed according to the two types of dopaminergic receptor hypothesis. Some apomorphine-induced effects (stereotyped behavior, circling behavior, climbing behavior, and increased motor activity) could be related to stimulation of one type of dopaminergic receptor, other effects (hypothermia and decreased activity) to the other type. Pimozide, sulpiride, thioproperazine, GRI 1665 and TER 1546, could block selectively one type of dopaminergic receptor, at least in a given range of doses. Clozapine, chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, and thioridazine, could block selectively the other type of dopaminergic receptor. Haloperidol, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, sultopride, and tiapride, could block both types of dopaminergic receptors with equal intensity whatever the dose.

The autonomic profile of mianserin has been compared with that of yohimbine, phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine and desmethylimipramine. The effects of mianserin on tyramine and noradrenaline pressor responses in the pithed rat were consistent with alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist and uptake blocking properties. In isolated tissue experiments, the selectivity of mianserin for pre- and postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors was similar to that of phentolamine. In pitched rats mianserin antagonised the pressor response produced by clonidine and reversed the inhibitory actions of clonidine on cardiac nerve stimulation. In contrast mianserin only caused slight reversal of the inhibitory effects of clonidine on hypogastric nerve stimulation. Uptake blockade itself inhibits hypogastric nerve stimulation and this could counteract any antagonism of the effects of clonidine at the presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor. The results demonstrate the uptake blocking properties of mianserin and its antagonism at both pre- and postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors.

SK & F 38393 (2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine) is a new dopamine receptor agonist which selectively increased renal blood flow when administered i.v. to dogs at cumulative doses of 3.3-1333 microgram/kg. Consistent changes in arterial blood pressure heart rate and cardiac output were not observed. The renal response, which was mediated locally in the kidney, was not antagonized by adequate blocking doses of atropine, propranolol, metiamide and/or mepyramine nor by reserpinization or treatment with indomethacin. It was inhibited, however, by the selective peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist, bulbocapnine. Perhaps as a result of its action on renal blood flow, SK & F 38393 produced a diuresis in normally hydrated rats which was characterized by an increased excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride and a increased urinary pH. Compounds of this type may be useful in better defining dopaminergic receptors and in the treatment of disease states where renal ischemia is present.

Intraventricular administration of 50 microgram of burimamide or 250 microgram of either metiamide or cimetidine decreased the NA concentration in rat hypothalamus by nearly 30%. Cimetidine did not significantly influence either DA or DOPAC levels in striatum. Cimetidine and metiamide significantly potentiated locomotor activity of tranylcypromine-treated rats and this effect was antagonized by phentolamine. It is concluded that the three histamine H2-receptor antagonists released NA in rat brain.

Haloperidol, pimozide, sulpiride and metoclopramide blocked bicuculline-induced convulsions in mice. Chlorpromazine and thioridazine exhibited this effect at low doses whereas at higher doses (e.g. 1 mg/kg i.p. chlorpromazine) this activity was no longer apparent. A dose of phenoxybenzamine which was inactive alone (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) completely blocked the anti-bicuculline effect of sulpiride and antagonized that of haloperidol. These data are interpreted as indicating that intact noradrenergic systems are necessary for the anti-bicuculline effect of the neuroleptics.

The responses of single neostriatal neurones to substantia nigra (SN) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) stimulation and iontophoretic administration of several drugs were studied in urethane-anaesthetised rats. Stimulation of the SN-evoked excitation followed by inhibition in striatal neurones. In some cells only inhibition of firing was evoked indicating that there may be separate nigrostriatal inhibitory and excitatory pathways. DRN stimulation evoked mainly inhibition of striatal cell firing. The activity of most neurones responding to SN and DRN stimulation was depressed by iontophoretically administered dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and GABA and increased by acetylcholine. Studies with antagonist revealed that alpha-flupenthixol reduced responses to dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine and inhibition evoked by SN and DRN stimulation. Bicuculline methochloride only reduced responses to GABA. Methysergide selectively reduced responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine and also reduced DRN-but not SN-evoked inhibition. It was concluded that the SN-evoked inhibition was probably mediated by dopamine and DRN-evoked inhibition by 5-hydroxytryptamine.

Experiments were performed in decerebrate rabbits to determine the sensitivity of the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) to macular stimulation. Twenty-three percent of the neurons recorded extracellularly in the LCN showed steady changes in their discharge rate during 20 degrees tilt in both directions of the medial plane. Most of these neurons exhibited an alpha- and beta-type of response. A few gamma-types, but no delta-types were observed. The units sensitive to tilt were restricted to the caudal half of the LCN. Some of these positionally sensitive neurons responded monosynaptically to ipsilateral labyrinthine stimulation, but many received a polysynaptic input. These units could be activated antidromically by stimulation of the oculomotor nucleus but at a very high intensity suggesting current spread to the nearby brachium conjunctivum fibers. These results exclude a role of the LCN in the disynaptic otolith-ocular reflex.

Loss of cristae and matrix occur in the mitochondria of skeletal muscles prior to any observable changes in myofibrillar proteins during the development of rigor mortis. Care must be observed because ultrastructural changes in mitochondria in some studies may be attributed to a specific trauma, whereas the changes may be due to the lower pH in postmortem muscle.

As determined by 31p-NMR spectroscopy, intracellular pH of hereditary spherocytes was lower (pH 6.7-6.9) than that of normal red cells. The level of adenosine diphosphate in hereditary spherocytes was found to be persistently high. The metabolism of nucleotides and other phosphoryl compounds in human red blood cells have been studied in detail by 31p-MNR spectroscopy. However, to our knowledge, there seems to be no report describing the result of 31p-NMR spectroscopy on red blood cells from hereditary spherocytosis.

In immature cockerels adrenaline administration lowered the levels of plasma growth hormone. Both alpha and beta adrenergic receptor agonists also depressed the circulating growth hormone levels. In the presence of beta blockade, the suppressive effect of adrenaline on growth hormone secretion was not observed.

This paper discusses the necessity of using both behavioral and family approaches in combination, while working with electively mute children. The symptom and its significance within the family system is presented along with a rationale for avoiding the pitfalls of individual approaches with such children. A case history outlining specific behavioral techniques is described in detail with an exploration of the use of reinforcement theory, counter-conditioning, and successive approximations in bringing about change in electively mute children. The need for bringing about changes within the family system so as to maintain the changes that have occurred through use of the behavior techniques is discussed and presented as crucial to the treatment process. The paper takes the position that either approach, by itself, will not be effective in helping electively mute children but that the treatment of choice is a combination of therapeutic techniques.

The action of adrenoblocking agents on the dynamics of the pain allaying effect of narcotic analgesics, measured by the magnitude of the pain reaction threshold after irritation of the tail skin with electric current was studies in tests on mice. The beta-adreno-blocking agent (anaprillin or inderal) was found to significantly potentiate and to lengthen the action of morphine, and so did, to a lesser degree, promedol (trimeperedin) and phentanyl, while the alpha-adrenoblocking agent (phentolamine) weakened the analgesic effects of morphine and promedol, without having any essential influence on the effect of phentanyl. Phentolamine does not eliminate the potentiating effect of anapraline on the analgesic action of morphine but is capable to lessen it.

A protocol of chronic antepartum surveillance was initiated at the University of Illinois hospitals in 1973 to assess the impact on perinatal mortality. At the same time, a policy of unselected fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring was initiated to judge the effect on the intrapartum stillbirth rate. The impact of both programs played a significant role in the decline of perinatal mortality rates for infants weighing more than 1 500 g, from 21.1/1 000 births in 1970--1971 to 14.4/1 000 births in the monitored years 1973 and 1974 (p less than 0.02).

Epithelia may be classified as "tight" or "leaky," depending on whether there is a significant pathway for transepithelial ion permeation via the junctions and bypassing the cells. The resistance of this paracellular channel may depend partly on structures visible in the electron microscope, partly on wall charge. Permeability determinations in the leaky junctions of gallbladder epithelium, using many different organic cations, suggest that the critical barriers barriers to ion permeation are 5--8 A in radius and bind cations by up to four strongly proton-accepting oxygens. The apical cell membrane of tight epithelia contains a Na+-selective channel that is blocked by amiloride and Ca2+, subject to negative feedback control by the Na+ pump in the basolateral membrane, and somehow promoted by aldosterone. To determine the permeabilities of these two channels (the junctional channel of leaky epithelia, and the Na+ channel of tight epithelia) to water and nonelectrolytes remains a major unsolved problem.

An analysis of 31 years of adolescent pregnancies and deliveries at Novi Sad Medical Facility is presented. Obstetric complications are discussed. The psychological impact of adolescent pregnancy is examined.

A total of 252 patients with carcinoma in situ colli uteri were treated at the Women's Clinic at Turku University between 1964 and 1971. Seventy-seven percent of the patients came to the clinic for treatment after they had participated in a mass screening program (cytodiagnosis, colposcopy). Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed most often on women in the older age groups, while most of the younger patients were treated by conization. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years. There was a 1.0% recurrence of invasive carcinoma and a 4.0% recurrence of noninvasive carcinoma. All invasive recurrences occurred after hysterectomy. None of the patients died from complications of carcinoma.

From March to December 1975, 496 patients were studied to compare the safety and effectiveness of menstrual regulation (MR) performed with a Karman hand syringe and first trimester abortion performed with an electric vacuum aspirator. All procedures were done on an outpatient basis. The complication rate for the MR patients was significantly lower than that for the other first trimester abortion patients. Study results indicate that MR with the Karman syringe is a safer, simpler and less costly procedure than first trimester abortion with the electric vacuum aspirator. Further research and study are necessary to determine the effect of the initial and repeat MR procedures on women's menstrual patterns and future pregnancies, including any subsequent prematurity, stillbirths and Rh immunization.

Five hundred women were interviewed within 2 days of delivery to examine indigenous birth spacing among the urban and rural population of Ife township. The crude birth interval was between 30 and 40 months due mainly to cultural attitudes towards lactation and sexual abstinence. The women studied possessed considerable knowledge of Western contraceptive methods, but they rejected them. The possible cause of this rejection is examined and solutions to the problem are suggested.

Vaginal trichomoniasis was treated with standard courses of oral metronidazole in 597 pregnant women. In 283 other pregnant women, the infection remained untreated. The incidences of low-birth-weight infants, stillbirths and congenital abnormalities were not affected by metronidazole treatment of trichomoniasis in pregnancy.

Antepartum nonstress fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring may become a valuable screening tool for all pregnancies. Two methods proposed for an antepartum FHR monitor are examined: abdominal electrocardiogram (AECG) and variable range directional Doppler (RDD). A good quality (detailed, clearcut baseline) RDD FHR record was obtained in 74/75 (99%) examinations, and a good quality AECG record was obtained i31/75 (41%). Each patient was monitored in the supine, lateral and sitting positions. Considering all positions, 76% of the RDD records and 19% of the AECG records were good. The RDD system was efficacious for routine, clinical antepartum FHR monitoring, but the performance of the AECG was too limited for this purpose.

Studies were made of 36 different nuts, grains, fruits and vegetables commonly used as human foods; each of these was fed to a group of ovariectomized rats for 10 days as a sole diet. The estrogenic activities of the foods were estimated by comparing the uterine weights, uterine fluid volumes and the vaginal cornification indices of each group of rats with those of groups fed other foods. Almonds, cashew nuts, peanuts, oats, corn, wheat and apples all showed estrogenic activity. The original sample of almonds showed the greatest estrogenic activity (p less than 0.01) which was confirmed by repetition of the experiment (p less than 0.01), but subsequent studies of other samples of almonds showed no estrogenic activity. Possible reasons for the disparity of the results with different lots of almonds are discussed.

Intrauterine adhesions (Asherman's syndrome) may follow curettage in a recently pregnant uterus. Treatment consisting of dilatation and curettage and possibly the insertion of an intrauterine device usually is started early. The success rate is high. Very few cases of spontaneous recurring menstruation have been reported, and none of them have been based on hysterosalpingographic evidence of adhesions. The pregnancy outcome is generally poor in those cases of assumed spontaneous resolution. We present a case of spontaneous restitution of a functional uterine cavity and normal menstruation following Asherman's syndrome. Subsequent pregnancy was uneventful. A short review of the literature is presented, and the possible self-limiting character of the disease is discussed.

The Obstetric Intensive Care Unit (OBICU) at Bellevue Hospital in New York City has adapted intensive care and coronary care models to the care of patients in labor. During the past 3 years, 519 of the most serious of 2 250 high-risk obstetric patients treated at the hospital were monitored in the OBICU. There were two maternal and six perinatal deaths. The perinatal mortality rate of the very high risk population of the OBICU was 11.6/1 000, compared to 14.7/1 000 for all deliveries performed at the hospital. Our findings indicate that the OBICU system provides the ideal mechanism for the rapid and continuous control of symptoms in very high risk gravidas which is essential for stabilizing the patient, both for prompt delivery and for optimal maternal and fetal survival.

Prostagland-n E2 (PGE2) was administered orally to 109 patients to induce labor. Sixty-five of these patients had an amniotomy prior to PGE2 administration. PGE2 was administered to the remaining. 44, who subsequently underwent amniotomy only after their cervices had reached approximately 6 cm dilation. Labor was successfully induced in 95 patients, but its duration was shorter when amniotomy was immediatedly followed by PGE2 administration. Failed cases were successfully managed with amniotomy and oxytocin infusion. Maternal side effects were minimal. No fetal complications occurred.

Fifty-one cases of burst abdomen occurred following 1 988 cesarean sections performed at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital over a 5-year period. The incidence of this occurrence was 2.6% (2.3% if all laparotomies in both obstetrics and gynecology are combined). The risk was three times as great for "unbooked" patients, who were first seen in labor. Possible etiologic factors and preventive measures are discussed.

Studies have shown a rapid rise of plasma estradiol-17beta in the maternal circulation before the occurrence of preterm labor. We have attempted to perform a linear regression analysis of the data from normal pregnancies and to set up a 95% upper prediction limit for the normal range of the estradiol level for each week of gestation. The prediction limits were reasonably good, with only five (13%) false negatives. False negatives tend to occur only in late pregnancy.

This study was conducted in Bombay, India, to evaluate the role of oral methylergonovine maleate (Methergine, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, N.J., USA) in augmenting the effect of intermittent extraamniotic instillation of 20% saline for midtrimester abortion in 200 patients. Methylergonovine maleate (MEM) administration was randomly allocated to half the study subjects. All the study procedures were performed by a single operator, and to minimize evaluator bias, another physician evaluated all the study patients after abortion. This study showed that a statistically significant higher percentage of patients in the MEM treated group aborted within 24 hours. At 36 and 48 hours, the differences were not statistically significant, although the cumulative abortion rates were higher for subjects who received the drug than for those who did not. The incidence of incomplete abortions was lower for those treated with MEM than for those not treated with the drug, but the difference was not statistically significant. The rates of complications and side effects were similar for both study groups.

A cervical cytologic diagnosis of inflammatory stypia was made in 319 patients during a 42-month period. Two hundred twenty-five of those patients underwent colposcopy, and biopsy was performed in 155 patients. Mild to severe dysplasia was diagnosed in 115 patients, for a 36% prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

Clinical otosclerosis is a familial disease which is more frequent among women in their reproductive years. The condition usuallly is aggravated by pregnancy. Endocrinologic variables may influence the time of onset and the course of the disease. It is suspected that oral contraceptives (OCs) might stimulate the onset of the disease. Six hundred nulliparous women between the ages of 16 and 30, who used a variety of OCs for 12-36 months, were examined. The hearing of these women was thoroughly investigated. The first audiometric examination of the 600 women revealed three cases (0.5%) of clinical otosclerosis. This incidence is equal to that of the population as a whole, but lower than the  incidence found in previously parous women. Audiometric examinations were normal in the remaining 597 women, and repeated examinations revealed no new cases of clinical otosclerosis, despite continuous OC use.

Two cases of gonadal dysgenesis in phenotypic females associated with different chromosomal patterns are discussed. Both patients presented with primary amenorrhea and were characterized by tall stature and underdeveloped secondary sex characteristics and external and internal reproductive organs. The karyotype of the first patient was 46,XX with a satellite on chromosome 17. The second patient had a normal female chromosome composition (46,XX) with a past history of mumps. Laparoscopic bilateral gonadal biopsies in both patients revealed fibrous tissue without any primordial follicles. This report emphasizes the pathogenesis, clinical significance, diagnosis and management of gonadal dysgenesis.

Six hundred fifty-eight laparoscopies were performed at St. Luke's Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri, USA, between March 1, 1976 and February 28, 1977. One hundred sixty-eight (25.5%) were performed for diagnostic purposes. A review of the preoperative diagnoses and the laparoscopic findings demonstrates the value of laparoscopy as a diagnostic procedure.

A rare case of endometriosis presenting as acute appendicitis is reported. Appendectomy was performed with excellent results.

Acute effects of amiloride (5 mg) (A), hydrochlorthiazide (50 mg) (H) and the combination (50 + 5 mg) (HA) on urinary electrolyte excretion and pH of ten healthy volunteers--taking placebo five times and twice randomly A and HA and once H--were studied during one day. Amiloride showed a natriuretic effect, which in combination was additive to that of hydrochlorthiazide, but the excretion of water did not increase significantly after A. The urinary excretion of potassium decreased with amiloride below normal levels and was at the level of placebo after the combination (HA). There was a striking linear correlation between urinary sodium and potassium with all the drugs, although showing with A a higher potassium retention during high sodium excretion. Urinary pH rose after A and HA during the first 8 hours, but this effect was not seen, however, after H. No significant differences in the effect of the two brands of A (Medamor and Puritrid) on the urinary electrolyte excretion and pH, nor in those of the two brands of HA (Moduretic and Amitrid) were found. Similarly, the plasma concentrations of hydrochlorthiazide, determined gas chromatographically, were equal after Moduretic and Amitrid tablets. The systemic availability of H was faster in the combination of HA than alone. In the AUC value of H, however, there was no significant difference between HA and H tablets.

Collagenase isolated mouse pancreatic islets were maintained in tissue culture for up to 5 months in a culture medium buffered with Hepes and the pH varying between 6.8 and 7.6. The amount of insulin released into the medium and the insulin response to glucose and glucose plus theophylline were measured during the culture period. It was found that islets cultured at pH 7.2 maintained the ability to release insulin into the medium for at least 5 months, which was longer than islets cultured at the other pH values. During the first weeks, the islets cultured at pH 7.6 had a higher response to both glucose and glucose plus theophylline than islets cultured at the other pH values, but later they lost their insulin releasing ability.

Both the microvillus and basal-lateral membrane components of intestinal epithelial cells were found to contain endogenous cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases and their endogenous protein substrates. The phosphorylation of either membrane component using [gamma-32P]ATP as substrate, occurred very rapidly, reaching maximal levels at 1 min. Both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP were shown to stimulate the phosphorylation of the microvillus and basal-lateral membranes; the approximate concentrations of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP required for half-maximal stimulation of phosphorylation were 2 x 10(-7) M and 1.7 x 10(-8) M, respectively, for the basal-lateral membranes, and 2 x 10(-7) M and 3.2 x 10(-8) M, respectively, for the microvillus membranes. Although both membrane components were phosphorylated by an endogenous protein kinase, the microvillus membrane was consistently phosphorylated to a greater extent at maximally effective concentrations of either cyclic nucleotide. The microvillus and basal-lateral membranes were also found to contain a phosphoprotein phosphatase; however, the rate of removal of [32P]phosphate from the microvillus membrane was found to be more rapid. Neither cyclic AMP nor cyclic GMP altered the activity of the enzyme in either membrane. The present results together with earlier studies are compatible with the possibility that the regulation of water and electrolyte transport in the small intestine by cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP may be mediated through modulation of the phosphorylation of protein components of the microvillus and basal-lateral membranes.

Premature labour is best treated in a special ward, the tocolysis ward. From 1972 to 1975 there were around 8% premature deliveries. During the first six months of 1976 there were still around 8% premature deliveries. During the second six months of 1976 the premature rate was lowered to 6% in the tocolysis ward. This is a decrease of the 25%.

The mutagenic properties of acridines on pneumococcus are described. All seven acridines tested were mutagenic at the amiA locus conferring a resistance to 10(-5) M aminopterin. The effects of quinacrine were more specifically investigated. It was observed that: mutants can be obtained only by treatment of exponentially growing cells; a sharp maximum mutagenic effect occurs at a concentration slightly lower than the bacteriostatic value; and the amount of quinacrine required to yield the maximum mutagenic effect decreases with the pH of the medium. Moreover, the number of mutants detected after quinacrine treatment varies from locus to locus. The majority of quinacrine-induced mutants are readily reverted by quinacrine, but not by nitrosoguanidine treatment. This suggests that in pneumococcus quinacrine induces mainly frameshift mutations. A further study of the revertants obtained by quinacrine treatment of quinacrine-induced mutants strengths this interpretation: most of the revertants result from a mutation at the same site; some partial revertants exhibiting an intermediate resistance to aminopterin were found to contain two very closely linked mutated sites, each mutation conferring the maximum level of resistance to aminopterin. Thus, the majority of quinacrine-induced mutants at the amiA locus of pneumococcus consists of frameshift mutations. Nearly all of the isolated mutants induced by quinacrine as well as other acridines belong to the low efficiency class of transformation. It was concluded that the mismatch resulting from the pairing between the wild type and the frameshift-containing sequence is recognized by the excision-repair system involved in the discrimination function in a way similar to that in which it recognizes mismatched base pairs between a transition mutation and the wild-type sequence.

Effects of the typical psychotropic drugs such as neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines on the monosynaptic reflex (MSR) and polysynaptic reflex (PSR) were investigated using intact and spinal cats. Drugs used were chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, droperidol, haloperidol, amitriptyline, imipramine, diazepam and flurazepam. Neuroleptics depressed the ventral root reflexes markedly to slightly in both preparations. The inhibitory effects of these drugs on MSR of intact cats were stronger than those on MSR of spinal cats, and the activity was slightly higher than that of PSR depression in intact preparations. In intact cats, those depressants effects of neuroleptics on PSR produced various characteristic action patterns in comparison with MSR inhibition. Tricyclic antidepressants were similar in the mode of action to the dimethylamino side-chain groups in phenothiazines, but the inhibitory effects of ventral root reflexes were distinctly weaker than that of neuroleptics. Benzodiazepines depressed only PSR without MSR inhibition, especially in spinal cats. Thus, it is suggested that the structure-activity relationship considered, a classification of the psychotropic drugs can be given according to the inhibitory activities on spinal ventral root reflexes in intact and spinal cats.

Triazolam was 4 to 5 times as potent as diazepam in reducing hyperemotionality of either septal-lesioned or olfactory bulbectomized rats (O.B. rats), and in suppressing muricide in O.B. rats. This agent was equipotent with diazepam in inhibiting fighting behavior of long-term isolated mice, but was longer in duration of action. Triazolam was approximately 4 times more potent than diazepam in preventing pentetrazol convulsion, but was 10 times less potent in inhibiting maximal electroshock convulsion in mice. The muscle relaxant effect of triazolam as assessed by the inclined screen test was 34 times, and the effect on rotarod performance was 17 times more potent than that of diazepam in mice. Triazolam (0.2 approximately 0.5 mg/kg i.v.) changed the EEG to a drowsy pattern in unanesthetized rabbits with a chronic electrode implant, and suppressed the EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and electrical stimulation given to either the mesencephalic reticular formation or posterior hypothalamus. The limbic afterdischarges induced by either hippocampal or amygdaloid stimulation were also markedly inhibited by triazolam. These EEG effects of triazolam were qualitatively similar to, but were 4 to 5 times more potent than those of diazepam. These results indicate that triazolam is a potent tranquilizer with a longer duration of action, and the muscle relaxant effect is considerable as compared with diazepam.

Effects of triazolam on various types of conditioned behavior were investigated and compared mainly with diaepam in rats. The active conditioned avoidance response of the rat in a Shuttle box was inhibited by triazolam and diazepam only at large doses. The passive avoidance response in a step-down method was not affected by either triazolam or diazepam, but was markedly suppressed by chlorpromazine. The low rate response of hypothalamic self-stimulation behavior was markedly increased by triazolam at doses ranging from 2 to 40 mg/kg p.o., but was suppressed at doses over 80 mg/kg p.o. The high rate response was unaffected by triazolam even at doses of 40 approximately 180 mg/kg p.o. The low rate response was increased by diazepam at doses of 1 approximately 10 mg/kg p.o. and was suppressed at 80 mg/kg p.o. The high rate response was reduced by diazepam at 180 mg/kg p.o. In the conflict situation of the rat subjected to food reward and foot-shock punishment, the lever press response in the unpunished period was reduced by triazolam at doses of 1 approximately 5 mg/kg p.o., whereas that in the punished period was markedly increased. Similar effects were observed with diazepam at doses of 15 approximately 20 mg/kg p.o. Triazolam appeared to be 10 approximately 15 times more potent than diazepam in this anticonfluct effect. Thus, triazolam appears to be a potent antianxiety agent.

Less than 20% of the amino acid content of the amino acid pool of Escherichia coli B exists in the D-form. Alanine, glutamic acid, and valine were shown by gas- chromatography to be partially in the D-form. Only D-alanine was formed by racemization in the crude extract of this organism. Alanine racemase was easily released from the membranes or vesicles but D-alanine oxidase activity remained firmly bound to the membrane. Most protein amino acids stimulated proline uptake into the vesicles, and the oxidative deamination activities were verified by the proline uptake stimulating amino acids. It is concluded that the obligatory pathway of L-amino acid--D-amino acid--oxo acid which exists in the oxidation of L-alanine does not exist with other L-amino acids. It is likely that other D-amino acids in the pool are formed in the presence of D-amino acid oxidase or D-amino acid aminotransferase.

The bulk of water and electrolyte absorption takes place in the human jejunum from isotonic solutions, and is determined largely by special transport mechanisms for different monosaccharides, amino acids and dipeptides. This is of considerable significance for regaining the large volumes of fluid delivered to the small intestine during the digestion of food. Small changes in intraluminal pH do not significantly influence the absorptive function of the jejunum and are rapidly compensated by the buffering capacity of the gut. The maintenance of an isotonic as well as neutral intraluminal milieu seems to be essential to the physiological processes of intestinal absorption.

Considerations and own experience regarding prophylactic administration of antibiotics and therapeutic customs in surgery are discussed. Based on own and long-term studies recommendations are given for effective and purposeful use of chemotherapy in surgery.

There is considerable similarity between paranoid schizophrenia and psychoses provoked by dopaminergic overstimulation in the central nervous system. The fact that neuroleptics are able to block dopaminergic neural activity has led to the hypothesis that there might exist a common biochemical substrate for schizophrenia and e. g. the amphetamine psychoses. Dopaminergic overstimulation may be elicited by different drugs interacting with the dopamine metabolism e. g. dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibition (disulfiram, fusaric acid); monoamine-oxidase-inhibition (phenelzine, tranylcypromine); dopamine release (amphetamine); stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors (bromocriptine, apomorphine). Resulting psychotic symptoms consist of ideas of reference, delusions, visual and acustic hallucinations in a clear setting of consciousness. Psychoses occur usually in subjects, who have suffered from various psychiatric illnesses, which have apparently in common a reduced monoamine-oxidase activity in platelets. It is concluded from various biochemical findings, that psychoses resulting from dopaminergic overstimulation and schizophrenia have different biological substrates.

A 12-year-old patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia received a bone-marrow transplant (BMT) from a matched sibling donor. Nine weeks prior to transplant the donor experienced Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced infectious mononucleosis. The bone-marrow recipient was EBV-negative at the time of transplant; however, 4 weeks post transplant the recipient developed clinical symptoms of graft-verus-host disease (GVHD) coincident with serological evidence of acute EBV infection. In addition, a lymphoblastoid cell line positive for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen was established from a bone-marrow sample obtained at the onset of symptoms compatible with GVHD. Sera obtained from the recipient over the ensuing 2 months showed the appearance of antibodies to specific EBV antigens consistent with a primary immune response to EBV infection. This association of acute EBV infection with symptoms of GVHD in a BMT recipient suggests a need for further investigation of the epidemiology of EBV infections in human bone-marrow transplantation and the relationship between EBV infection and GVHD.

We examined the velocity constants of buccal absorption in the case of 10 drugs. The measurements tending towards what is the coherence between the velocity constants and the physico-chemical parameters of the drugs. On the basis of our investigations one can see that the dipol moment offers more reliable information for the size of the velocity of absorption than the lipid-water distribution ratio, molecular radii or diffusion constants. Our opinion is that it can be useful in modifying and planning the drug molecules.

In the course of preparing aryl azide derivatives for use as photoprobes, we have observed significant light sensitivity in the precursor aryl diazonium compounds. The photosensitive properties of this class of compounds are of interest since they will seek out cationic binding sites in biological targets, and can be employed to inhibit complementary targets at acid pH. The relationship between photolytic change in the structure of diazonium compounds and the corresponding change in function of a biological target are presented. Experiments are described in which the dark and light sensitive properties of a model diazonium compound, diazobenzene sulfonate (DBS), were determined. The ultraviolet spectra were used to evaluate the dark stability and light sensitivity of DBS. Chymotrypsin and trypsin served as functioning targets for further evaluation of the photochemical properties. Both enzymes are stable to the probe in the dark at acid pH. A rapid loss of enzyme activity was observed following flash photolysis of DBS-enzyme solutions. Photolytic incorporation of radioactive DBS into chymotrypsin was observed. Aryl diazonium salts can be employed to probe the availability of complementary sites in biological targets at different acid pH values.

Studies are reported on the denaturation of freshly prepared, intact swine pepsin, which was inactivated by reaction with diazoacetylglycine ethyl ester, to prevent autolysis. Denaturation about pH 6 was found to involve a small expansion of the molecular domain with some loss of organized secondary structure. On the other hand, increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride induced cooperative transitions in both the native and alkali denatured forms to give a cross-linked random coil. No conditions could be found in which these reactions were reversible. Removal of denaturing conditions usually resulted in aggregation and precipitation of protein. From these studies, it would seem that the active conformation is largely predetermined in the zymogen.

Numerous modifications have been made in MK solution, primarily concerned with alterations in both bicarbonate concentration and PCO2. Variations of the solutions from high bicarbonate to low bicarbonate and either high or low PCO2 were made which resulted in a decreased net bicarbonate flux across the endothelium after a 3-day storage period. Even with drastic changes in the storage solution there was a relatively small change in the net bicarbonate flux. Higher passive fluxes were found at a pH above 8, and a higher net flux with a bicarbonate concentration of 17.5 nM or higher. Variation in PCO2 made little difference to the net endothelial fluxes; when a high PCO2 was used, there was a concurrent elevation of PO2 in the storage solution, but no beneficial effect was found on the endothelial transport system. It was apparent that a good storage solution contained a buffer (bicarbonate was better than phosphate) and 5% dextran and was at a neutral pH (between 7 and 8).

Peripheral blood lymphocytes from a patient with T cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia were examined by a combination of cell markers (E and M rosettes, and surface Ig), the graft-vs.-host reaction, thymic humoral factor (THF) and scanning electron microscopy. It was not possible, at first, to determine by conventional methods whether the leukemic cells were of the B or T type, but the THF and graft-vs.-host reaction showed that T cell precursors were present. These cells were incompetent immature T cells that underwent maturation following treatment with THF. Three months later, the T cell nature of the disease was clearly demonstrated by the E rosette technique, although at this time the cells were no longer influenced by THF.

Today neuropharmacas are a helpful part in the conservative treatment of the neurogenic bladder disorders. They are, or course, no "wonder-drugs" and usually lead to an improvement only of the troubles, but rarely to complete cure. If monotherapy does not lead to the results wanted, one should combine drugs of the same of similar effects but with different pharmacologic targets. A real progress was reached through alpha-receptor-blockers, whose use has, especially in children with myelomeningocele, changed the therapeutic concept in favour of a largely conservative treatment. We already know a number of substances that in one way or other influence the muscles of the bladder and the bladder outlet. If only part of them will reach clinical usage, it can be assumed that the pharmacotherapy will become even more meaningful in the treatment of neurogenic bladder disorders.

Currently practiced methods for the detection of gram negative bacteriuria require culturing and overnight incubation. Such an approach to bacteriuria detection is unacceptable for any screening program which requires rapid presumptive evidence of infection. In this study, the lipopolysaccharide-dependent formation of a unique dye absorption spectra of the cationic carbocyanine dye, 1-ethyl-2-[3-(1-ethylnaphtho[1,2d]-thiazolin-2-ylidene)-2-methylpropenyl] naphtho[1,2d]-thiazolium bromide, was used to detect bacteriuria caused by gram negative organisms in a hospitalized population. In an evaluation of 168 first morning and randomly collected suspected bacteriuric urines, the dye test detected 66% of the loop plate positive urines with false positive and false negative values of 28% and 34%, respectively. However, 37% of the false positive results occurred in urines containing less than 10(5) gram negative bacteria/ml and an additional 24% of the false positives were seen for patients currently receiving antibiotic treatment. Urine specimens were also evaluated using the limulus lysate assay for lipopolysaccharide.

The question whether the phosphate participates actively in the calculogenesis or whether it is only an accidental enclosure in the stone material can, in our opinion, only be answered by the quantitative determination of phosphorus in the stone material resp. in the organic stone matrix. The high enrichment of phosphorus in the stone material, in comparison with the urine, as well as its additional significant enrichment in the stone matrix, compared with the (crystalline) stone material, both deduced from our analytical data, nearly exclude a passive role of the phosphate in the calculogenesis. On the basis of our investigation we suppose that the phosphate crystalluriae, occurring spontaneously or induced, at moderate pH-values of urine, especially by Ca-oxalate, sometimes by urate crystalluriae, contribute to the crystal "density" in the urine, the sufficient crystal "density" being one of the preconditions for the formation of compact crystal aggregates; the other precondition is the presence of the reactive organic cement substance in a sufficient concentration. This active crystal agglomerating component is represented, in our conception, by partially hemolysed blood cells resp. by the cholesterol of their damaged membranes.

The problems of male sterility are considered in the light of fundamentals underlying the embryology and histophysiology of spermatogenesis and its hormonal control. Some forms of infertility are now understood but no treatment for them has yet been found. The mechanisms of other forms still elude firm definition: this is the case of, among others, some oligoasthenospermias in which, according to our experience, excessive estrogen production appears to play a physiopathologic role. In the prevailing uncertainty about therapeutic methods, the best short-term solutions in this field are in-vitro enhancement of the sperm's fecundating power and the improvement of artificial insemination techniques.

Steady-state passive hyperventilation alkalosis produces a predictable increase in oxygen uptake (VO2) proportional to the change in arterial pH (pHa) while variable changes in VO2 have been reported during alkali infusion. To compare metabolic with respiratory alkalosis 17 dogs were anesthetized with halothane and their VO2 response to respiratory alkalosis evaluated by hyperventilation. The pHa measured during this phase was duplicated during the later continuous infusion of NaHCO3 at which time either 1) ventilation was held constant at the control level, allowing arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) to rise as a consequence of the bicarbonate dissociation, or 2) PaCO2 was held constant by servo control of ventilation. Hyperventilation (pHa 7.6, PaCO2 13 Torr) produced an average increase in VO2 of 24%. During the bicarbonate infusion at constant ventilation (pHa 7.6, PaCO2 45 Torr) VO2 increased only 7%; however, when PACO2 was held constant by servo ventilation VO2 increased 21% above control. We conclude that respiratory and metabolic alkalosis produce similar increases in VO2 when steady-state acid-base conditions are achieved.

Eight subjects exercised on an ergometer until exhaustion. Femoral venous blood was analyzed for lactate, pyruvate, protein, electrolytes, and acid-base parameters. Muscle samples taken during the recovery period from m. quadriceps femoris were analyzed for water, electrolytes, lactate, and acid-labile CO2. Water content in the muscle biopsy sample was increased after exercise to 78.7 +/- 0.5% compared with the normal 76.7 +/- 0.8% at rest. The distribution of water between the extra- and intracellular space was calculated by the chloride method. In spite of elevated PCO2 in femoral venous blood the content of acid-labile CO2 was decreased in muscle after exercise. One minute after termination of exercise muscle CO2 was about half of the normal content at rest. During the recovery period muscle CO2 increased but was 20 min after termination of exercise still significantly below the value at rest. Intracellular pH (pHi) and bicarbonate concentration ([HCO3-]i) in muscle have been calculated. The validity of the assumptions underlying the calculations are thoroughly discussed. pHi decreased from the normal value at rest, 7.00 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- SD), to about 6.4 after exercise. [HCO3-] decreased from 10.2 +/- 1.2 mmol/l at rest to about 3 mmol/l after exercise. The changes are the greatest so far reported for an in vivo situation. After 20 min recovery pHi was almost the same as at rest, whereas bicarbonate was still well below.

We find ourselves as schools of nursing in a period in which external pressures are increasing on the school and the university as the public and its representatives require better accounting for the resources as assigned to the university and access to the decisions as to the use of the resources. At the same time, our systems of governance are not fully functioning and in many cases the dysfunctions consume faculty time rather than releasing time to the developmental tasks. This situation thus should not be ignored but must be dealt with to permit the growth to proceed.

A survey was made of 106 medical schools to determine the presence of the academic health center concept in the United States. Five centers were selected for an in-depth study of the attitudes and behavior of health center students, faculty members, and administrators in the professions of dentistry, medicine, nursing and basic science. The results were based on the return of 2,399 questionnaires which investigated the attitudes and behavior of the groups described relative to the health center concept. It was found that attitudes and behavior relative to the health center concept were different among professions, among various statuses of people within professions and among those persons functioning within the various health center administrative structures.

The primary purpose of this article has been to outline and discuss the fourteen steps of the systematic approach to modular development utilized by the author. In addition, examples of each step have been included in an effort to illustrate each point. The article ends with a list of useful resources for the beginning module developer and a statement about the value of each resource.

The time-dependent increase in stability, as measured in terms of the rate of dissolution, of collagen fibrils formed in vitro from pepsin-treated collagen was significantly affected only by temperature, and not by either ionic strength or pH. This is in contrast with collagen fibril formation, a process which is greatly affected by ionic strength and pH. Within the range of temperature 29-37 degrees C, lower temperature caused slower fibril formation and faster fibril stabilization. These results suggest that the intermolecular interactions involved in stabilizing collagen fibrils are entirely different from those involved in fibril formation. Based on kinetic analysis of the dissolution and stabilization of the fibrils, it is proposed that collagen molecules first form unstable fibrils which become gradually stabilized on prolonged incubation, without necessarily introducing covalent cross-links.

Three new protease inhibitors were isolated and purified about 200-fold from hemolymph of silkworm larvae, Bombyx mori, using ion-exchange and affinity chromatography. Two of the three inhibitors were basic proteins (SCI-I had pI 9.4 and SCI-II had pI 9.6) and one was acidic (SCI-III had pI 4.0). The molecular weight of each inhibitor was determined to be 7,000 by the sedimentation equilibrium method. The amino acid composition of the inhibitors were similar except for the contents of Asp, Glu, Ile, Leu, and Lys. Val, His, and Trp were not present in the inhibitors and Met appeared only in SCI-III. The CD spectra of the inhibitors were all similar and indicated a low content of alpha-helical structure (10% at most). Each inhibitor could inhibit the protease and esterase activities of bovine alpha-chymotrypsin at a one-to-one molar ratio, and the dissociation constants were 3.1 X 10(-9)M for SCI-I and II and 1.3 X 10(-8)M for SCI-III. Only SCI-II showed a weak inhibitory activity against bovine trypsin. Subtilisin BPN' and papain were not inhibited by these inhibitors.

The differentiation of rat liver lysosomal acid phosphatase, acid ATPase, acid phosphodiesterase, acid ribonuclease, and acid deoxyribonuclease was studied by isoelectric focusing. To prevent autolytic digestion, inhibitors of cathepsins and neuraminidase were used. The proportion of acidic forms of acid phosphatase, acid ATPase and acid phosphodiesterase was increased by the use of extraction medium containing 0.05% Triton X-100. To investigate the identity of acid ATPase and acid phosphodiesterase, the relative activities among the multiple forms of these enzymes, the acid phosphodiesterase/acid ATPase ratio at each activity peak, and the degree of enzyme inhibition by p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid were estimated. The results suggest that acid ATPase is not identical with acid phosphodiesterase. With extraction medium free of Triton X-100, acid ribonuclease appeared in two forms. However, in addition to these forms, a new form of this enzyme with a more acidic pI (4.22) emerged when extraction medium containing 0.05% Triton X-100 was used. The major peak of acid deoxyribonuclease with pI=8.40-9.39 was obtained regardless of the extracting method.

A ribonuclease H, an enzyme that specifically degrades the RNA moiety of RNA-DNA hybrid, has been partially purified from rat liver nuclei and characterized. Neither native or denatured DNA, nor single or double-stranded synthetic polyribonucleotides were degraded by the enzyme. The enzyme possesses a molecular weight of about 36,000 and requires alkaline pH, magnesium ions, and ammonium sulphate for maximum activity. The enzyme acts on the hybrid as an endonuclease, resulting in oligonucleotides with 3'-hydroxyl termini. The properties of this enzyme were distinct from those of the rat liver cytosol enzyme reported by Roewekamp and Sekeris in many respects, such as molecular weight, optimal pH and requirements for divalent cations. Preliminary experiments suggest that the nuclear enzyme is localized in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli. These results indicate that multiple forms of ribonuclease H exist in different regions of rat liver cells.

The cytosolic fumarase [EC 4.2.1.2[ of rat liver was bound, after dialysis, to the microsomal membrane in vitro. Binding of the enzyme was dependent on pH, and was facilitated in the pH range below 7.5. The binding reaction was completely inhibited by 0.5 mM fumarate, aurintricarboxylate or colchicine. The bound fumarase was released from the membrane by the substrates, isocitrate, citrate or 2,3-diphosphoglycerate at low concentrations. Desorption of the enzyme by metabolites was also dependent on pH, and was more rapid in the alkaline pH range. The enzyme desorption curves were sigmoidal, and kinetic studies suggested a biphasic cooperative mechanism for the action of the metabolites. The apparent desorption constants (concentrations necessary for 50% desorption of the enzyme) estimated at pH 7.3 for isocitrate, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, L-malate, oxalacetate, fumarate, citrate, succinate, and KCl were 0.073, 0.074, 0.22, 0.39, 0.56, 2.9, and 19 mM, respectively. The bound fumarase showed little enzymatic activity, and its Km and Vmax values were fivefold and 31%, respectively, of those of the free enzyme.

We have detected in rat liver cytosol three enzymes (termed C-1, C-2, and C-3) which cleaved the RNA moiety of RNA-DNA hybrid. These enzymes were separated from each other by DEAE-Sephadex and Sephadex G-200 chromatography. C-1 and C-2 specifically act on the RNA moiety of RNA-DNA hybrid, while C-3 degrades single-stranded RNA as well as the RNA of the hybrid. The molecular weights of C-1, C-2, and C-3 are about 110,000, 35,000 and 110,000 daltons, respectively, and their activities are absolutely dependent on divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Mn2+. Cleavage by C-1 and C-2 is endonucleolytic, producing mostly oligonucleotides and a small amount of mononucleotides which possess 3'-hydroxyl termini. It seems likely that C-2 is originally present in the nucleus and is released into cytosol because of its loose binding to the nuclear components. As for biochemical properties, C-1 is very similar to the cytosol ribonuclease H initially reported by Roewekamp and Sekeris, and C-2 is very similar to the nuclear ribonuclease H reported by us in the preceding paper.

1. A large fluorescence enhancement of 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS) observed in the presence of amylose was utilized to monitor quantitatively the time course of porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase [EC 3.2.1.1] (PPA)-catalyzed hydrolysis of amylose with a number-average degree of polymerization of 16.8. 2. The slope of the plot of decrease in the relative fluorescence intensity of the TNS-amylose system (termed as the fluorescence value) versus the number of linkages hydrolyzed (reducing value) (Kondo, H. et al. (1977) Agric. Biol. Chem. 41, 631-634) in the course of PPA-catalyzed hydrolysis was shown to be useful to describe the degree of "multiple attack," which is defined by the number of reattacks on a long chain substrate molecular per one encounter of the enzyme and the substrate. A parameter gamma was defined as the ratio of the reciprocal of the slopes obtained at each pH to that at pH 10.5, where the multiple attack is not operating. 3. The gamma versus pH profile gave an apparent pK value of about 9, indicating that some ionizable groups participate in the multiple attack mechanism. 4. Based on a reaction scheme involving a "sliding" of the substrate molecule on the enzyme, which may contribute to the multiple attack mechanism, besides binding, dissociation, and cleavage steps of the substrate, and on the assumption of the steady state for the enzyme-substrate complex, rate equations were obtained to describe the time course of hydrolysis of a linear substrate. The product distribution with the progress of the reaction can be calculated theoretically, and is dependent on the number of multiple attack and the mode of sliding. The number of multiple attack can be estimated from this distribution, and the fluorescence value can be calculated theoretically by combining the product distribution with the relative efficiency of fluorescence intensity of each maltooligosaccharide (Nakatani, H. et. al. (1977) Biopolymers 16, 2363-2370). By comparing the experimental data with the theoretical ones, it was suggested that the multiple attack occurs through the sliding by maltose unit of the retained fragment on the enzyme, which is one of the fragments produced by the initial cleavage of the substrate molecule. 5. It was found that anions (chloride, bromide, and nitrate ions) which critically affect the enzyme activity have no effect on the degree of multiple attack.

The subunit structure was studied of islets-activating protein (IAP), a new protein recently isolated from the culture media of Bordetella pertussis and possessing a unique action, i.e., potentiating insulin secretory responses of animals, IAP dissociated into three subunits, F-1, F-2, and F-3, when incubated in 8M urea. Three subunits isolated by chromatography on CM-Sepharose and DEAE-Sepharose columns showed different molecular weights (F-1: 44,000, F-2: 20,000, F-3: 11,000) and different isoelectric points, but similar amino acid compositions. The F-1 subunit consisted of two polypeptide chains linked by S-S bonding(s), while the F-2 and F-3 subunits were single-chain peptides. These subunits, none of which was biologically active alone, associated upon incubation for 2 h at 37 degrees C and regained biological activities after association only when the F-3 subunit was present in the association product. Thus, the F-3 subunit was essential, and the F-1 and F-2 subunits were permissive, for the development of IAP activity in animals.

Microorganisms capable of producing L-pyrrolidonecarboxylate peptidase [L-pyrrolidonyl peptidase, EC 3.4.11.8] were screened and a strain of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was chosen as one of the most potent producers of the enzyme. The enzyme was purified from lysozyme-lysate of the bacterial cells by salting out with ammonium sulfate, adsorption on DEAE-cellulose, covalent chromatography on PCMB-Sepharose and by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. By these procedures, the enzyme was purified about 800-fold with an activity recovery of 9%, and the preparation was electrophoretically homogenous. The enzyme was most active and stable at pH 7-8. The presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and EDTA was effective for stabilizing the enzyme. The molecular weight was estimated to be 72,000 by the gel filtration method and to be 24,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the enzyme is a subunit oligomer, presumably trimer. The enzyme was inactivated by the addition of PCMB, sodium tetrathionate, Hg2+ and Cu2+, but the activity lost was restored by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol and EDTA. The purified enzyme split amide and ester linkages in L-pyroglutamyl derivatives of L-alanine, beta-naphthylamine, alpha-naphthol, and 4-methylumbelliferone, but was completely inert towards various peptides and esters used as substrates for usual amino- and carboxy-peptidases, and for endopeptidases such as trypsin, subtilisin and alpha-chymotrypsin.

The purified alpha-thiophosphate diastereoisomers of adenosine 5'-(1-thio)-triphosphate were used to study the stereochemical course of the reaction catalyzed by yeast acetyl-CoA synthetase. Asymmetrically labeled adenosine 5'-thiophosphate was formed from the "B" diastereoisomer of adenosine 5'-(1-thio)-triphosphate and [18O]acetate. The label was found to be in the opposite orientation from the leaving pyrophosphate group showing that the acetate activation step occurred with inversion of configuration at the alpha-phosphorus.

The O2 binding properties of sulfhemoglobin were studied. The oxygen tension required for half-saturation of sulfhemoglobin is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that for hemoglobin A. The binding of O2 exhibits an alkaline Bohr effect larger than that observed for hemoglobin, yet the Hill number is unity. From the Bohr titration curve, 0.68 proton is released during O2 binding at 0 degrees C. Sulfhemoglobin prepared from carboxypeptidase A-treated hemoglobin has an affinity for O2 which is about the same as that of sulfhemoglobin at the theoretical limit of the Bohr titration curve. Like its carboxypeptidase A-treated hemoglobin precursor, this sulfhemoglobin does not bind O2 cooperatively. Thus, sulfhemoglobin appears to be in a high affinity form at alkaline pH and a low affinity form at acid pH, similar to hemoglobin A. These results demonstrate that the magnitude of the Hill number is not always an indicator of the interaction between oxygen binding and other functions in a hemoglobin.

Toxin II isolated from the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata enhances activation of the action potential sodium ionophore of electrically excitable neuroblastoma cells by veratridine and batrachotoxin. This heterotropic cooperative effect is identical to that observed previously with scorpion toxin but occurs at a 110-fold higher concentration. Depolarization of the neuroblastoma cells inhibits the effect of sea anemone toxin as observed previously for scorpion toxin. Specific scorpion toxin binding is inhibited by sea anemone toxin with KD approximately equal to 90 nM. These results show that the polypeptides scorpion toxin and sea anemone toxin II share a common receptors site associated with action potential sodium ionophores.

D-amino acid oxidase, a flavoprotein from hog kidneys, has been crystalized in two different forms. Orthorhombic prisms have been obtained from the enzyme.benzoate complex at pH 8.3; the space group is C2221 and the cell dimensions are a = 325A, b = 138.8 A, c = 200 A. At lower pH values, the enzyme crystallizes in trigonal prisms with a = b = 116.0 A, c = 399 A, space group P3112 or its enantiomorph. The two crystal forms have been obtained at 28 degrees C while at 4 degrees C only weak evidence of crystallization has been detected. In both crystalline modifications, the protein is highly associated.

Purified prostaglandin endoperoxides (PGG2 and PGH2) and hydroperoxides (15-OOH-PGE2) as well as fatty acid hydroperoxides (12-OOH-20:4, 15-00H-20:4, and 13-OOH-18:2) were examined as effectors of soluble splenic cell guanylate cyclase activity. The procedures described (in the miniprint supplement) for the preparation, purification, and characterization of these components circumvented the use of diethyl ether which obscured effects of lipid effectors because of contaminants presumed to be ether peroxides which were stimulatory to the cyclase. Addition of prostaglandin endoperoxides or fatty acid hydroperoxides to the reaction mixture led to a time-dependent activation of guanylate cyclase activity; 2.5- to 5-fold stimulation was seen during the first 6 min. The degree of stimulation and rate of activation were dependent on the concentration of the fatty acid effector; when initial velocities (6 min) were assessed half-maximal stimulation was achieved in the range of 2 to 3 micrometer. However, by extending the incubation time to 90 min similar maximal increases in specific activity could be achieved with 3 or 10 micrometer PGG2 or PGH2. Activation of guanylate cyclase upon addition of prostaglandin endoperoxides or fatty acid hydroperoxides was prevented or reversed by the thiol reductants dithiothreitol (3 to 5 mM) or glutathione (10 to 15 mM). Na2S2O4, not known as an effective reducing agent of disulfides, prevented but was relatively ineffective in reversing activation after it had been induced by PGG2. Pretreatment of the enzyme preparation with increasing concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide in the range of 0.01 to 1.0 mM prevented activation by PGG2 without affecting basal guanylate cyclase activity. These observations indicate that fatty acid hydroperoxides and prostaglandin endoperoxides promote activation of the cyclase by oxidation of enzyme-related thiol functions. In contrast PGE2, PGF2a, hydroxy fatty acids (13-OH-18:2, 12-OH-20:4) as well as saturated (18:0) monoenoic (18:1), dienoic (18:2), and tetraenoic (20:4) fatty acids were ineffective in promoting cyclase activation in the range of 1 to 10 micrometer. Studies to identify the species of the rapidly metabolized prostaglandin endoperoxides that serve as effectors of the cyclase indicated that PGG2 but not 15-OOH-PGE2 (the major buffer-rearrangement product of PGG2) is most likely an activator. In the case of PGH2, a rapidly generated (30 s) metabolite of PGH2 was found which contained a hydroperoxy or endoperoxy functional group and was equally as effective as PGH2 as an apparent activator of the enzyme. The combined effects of PGG2 and dehydroascorbic acid, another class of activator, exhibited additivity with respect to the rate at which the time-dependent activation was induced. These results suggest that activation of soluble guanylate cyclase from splenic cells can be achieved by the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups that may be associated with specific hydrophobic sites of the enzyme or a related regulatory component.

A method has been developed for the preparation of large numbers of glial (Muller) cells from the turtle retina. After proteolytic dissociation of the retina, Muller cells were separated from retinal neurons by velocity sedimentation at unit gravity. Fractions containing >90 percent morphologically identifiable Muller cells were prepared by this procedure. Fractions containing only Muller cells were obtained by drawing selected cells individually into a micropipette under visual observation. Biochemical analyses of isolated Muller cells showed that (a) these cells did not synthesize and accumulate acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, or catecholamines when incubated with appropriate radioactive precursors; (b) the specific activities of choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6), glutamate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15), and tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2) in these cells were less than 2 percent of those found in the retina; (c) Muller cells, however, contained high activities of transmitter degrading enzymes-acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) and gamma-aminobutyrate- transamine (EC 2.6.1.19); and (d) the cells also possessed high levels of two presumably glial-specific-enzymes-glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) and carbonic anhydrase (EC 4.2.1.1). These results, together with other findings, suggest that Muller cells are not capable of neurotransmitter syntheses but possess the enzymes necessary for two important roles in the retina: (a) the inactivation of certain transmitters after synaptic transmission by uptake and degradation, and (b) the maintenance of acid-base balance and the provision of a stable microenvironment in the retina by the removal of metabolic products such as carbon dioxide and ammonia.

RMI 14, 514 ([5-tetradecycloxy]-2-furancarboxylic acid) represents a new class of hypolipidemic agents which cause unusual ultrastructural changes in liver of male rats and in selected peroxisomal enzymes in liver and kidney of both sexes. Among the principal ultrastructural changes in peroxisomes of male rat liver were (a) cavitation and compartmentalization of the matrix, often giving the appearance of a peroxisome-within-a-peroxisome, and (b) narrow, dense extensions of canaliculi or cisterns from the  periphery of the peroxisome, forming partial circlets or surrounding irregular areas of cytoplasm. The unusual enzyme responses were (a) elevation of catalase activity in liver and kidney in female rats, (b) increased activity of three hydrogen peroxide-producing oxidases (urate oxidase, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase) in the liver of both sexes, and (c) elevation of activity of the last two oxidases in male kidney. The peculiar ultrastructural changes in liver peroxisomes combined with the responses of selected peroxisomal enzymes represent unusual modulations or adaptations of these organelles to a hypolipidemic agent, the effects of which have not been reported extensively.

Retractor unguis nerve muscle preparations from the locust were subjected to the zinc iodide-osmium tetroxide reaction (ZIO) after pre-fixation in glutaraldehyde. Applied for 18 h at 4 degrees C in the dark, ZIO reacts at pH 4.2--4.0 fairly selectively with the matrix of synaptic vesicles. Approximately 53% of the vesicles are completely and 4% partially stained. The percentage of ZIO-positive vesicles is increased to nearly 90% and reduced to 4% or less by pretreatment with SH-protecting (dithiothreitol) or SH-blocking (N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid) and SH-oxidizing (azodicarboxylic acid-bis-dimethylamide) reagents, respectively. Stimulation of the motor nerve at 20 Hz for 7 min, partially fatiguing synaptic transmission, reduces the number of vesicles per square micrometer of terminal area by approximately 52%; 2 min of rest restores this number of its pre-stimulation level. These changes are chiefly accounted for by changes in the number of completely ZIO-positive vesicles. 2 min after the end of stimulation, partially ZIO-positive vesicles are three times more frequent than before. With all experimental conditions, the average volume of vesicles was as follows: ZIO-negative less than partially ZIO-positive less than completely ZIO-positive. The average volume of ZIO-positive vesicles is almost unaffected by stimulation; that of ZIO-negative vesicles is decreased by 25% immediately after stimulation, increasing with subsequent rest to the initial level after 1 h. It is suggested (a) that ZIO demonstrates intravesicular protein(s) containing SH-groups and (b) that the completely ZIO-positive vesicles represent the mature ones ready to be used for transmitter release. How the ZIO reaction differentiates between different developmental stages of vesicles which could arise from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is discussed.

The formation of large aggregates by ionic interactions between acidic glucosaminoglycans and cationic secretory proteins has been proposed as one of the critical steps in the concentration process in the condensing vacuoles of secretory cells. In this paper, this hypothesis was tested by studies on the interactions between bovine chymotrypsinogen A and chondroitin sulfate as a simplified model. Small amounts of chondroitin sulfate were found able to induce chymotrypsinogen precipitation. Like zymogen granules, the resulting aggregates were moderately sensitive to ionic strength and insensitive to osmolality. Moreover, their pH dependence was similar to that of isolated zymogen granules. When sulfated glucosaminoglycans isolated from the zymogen granules of the guinea pig pancreas were used instead of chondroitin sulfate, the same kind of interactions with chymotrypsinogen were obtained. Our data support the hypothesis that the strong ionic interactions between those sulfated glucosaminoglycans and cationic proteins could be responsible for the concentration process.

Desialylation of human red blood cells (RBC) by Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (VCN) was found to produce cells with electrophoretic properties which were inconsistent with the view of simple loss of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) as the sole effect of VCN treatment. Modification of human RBC with 50--350 U VCN/10(10) RBC for one hour at 37 degrees C releases 90-100% of the NANA and produces a progressive decrease towards zero in their electrophoretic mobilities when measured in 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.2) at 25 degrees C. The appearance of positive groups on the desialylated cells was indicated by the VCN-treated cells displaying positive mobilities below approximately pH 5.5 and increased negative mobilities at approximately pH 9 as well as substantial increases in their mobility at neutral pH following treatment with formaldehyde. Adsorption of about 95% of the VCN activity at 0 degrees C to the RBC did not produce any significant change in their electrophoretic mobilities thus indicating that the observed changes in the electrophoretic properties of the RBC following VCN treatment could not be attributable to adsorption of VCN. These studies indicate that the cationic charge groups which appear at the electrophoretic surface of the RBC after VCN treatment are probably of endogenous origin. It is suggested that this alteration rather than simple NANA release may operate to shorten the in vivo survival time of desialylated red cells.

This paper describes a rapid and sensitive method for analysis of lorazepam and its glucuronide metabolite in plasma and urine following therapeutic doses of lorazepam in humans. After addition of the structurally related benzodiazepine derivative, oxazepam, as the internal standard, 1-ml samples of plasma or urine are extracted twice at neutral pH with benzene (containing 1.5% isoamyl alcohol). The combined extracts are evaporated to dryness, reconstituted, and subjected to gas chromatographic analysis using a 3% OV-17 column and an electron-capture detector. Lorazepam glucuronide in urine is similarly analyzed following enzymatic cleavage with Glusulase. The sensitivity limits are 1--3 ng of analyzed following enzymatic cleavage with Glusulase. The sensitivity limits are 1--3 ng of lorazepam per ml of original sample, and the variability of identical samples is 5% or less. The applicability of the method to pharmacokinetic studies of lorazepam is demonstrated.

Rat-incisor phosphoprotein (RIP) has been subjected to isoelectric focusing at 4 degrees in (a) an Ampholine pH gradient of 2.5-4 and (b) an acid pH gradient created by electrolysis of a system of acids and acidic ampholytes and covering the pH range 0.5-3.5. In the Ampholine gradient, the RIP unexpectedly formed several adjacent and strongly opalescent bands in the pH range 2.5-3.1. These bands, which migrated slowly toward the anode on prolonged focusing, are interpreted as being the result of an interaction between the amino groups of the Ampholine and the numerous phosphate groups of the protein. In the acid pH gradient, the RIP focused into one narrow zone corresponding to an isoelectric pH of 1.1 at 4 degrees. This value is consistent with the amino-acid composition and the phosphate content of the protein,

Several modifications of the roll-tube method have made it simpler for routine use in the isolation and growth of anaerobic bacteria. These include use of a check valve for the production of prereduced anaerobically sterilized media; a Salvarsan tube under oxygen-free gas pressure for the dispensing of molten prereduced anaerobically sterilized agar medium; a Kelly infusion bottle with a graduated pipette side arm (also under gas pressure) for quantitative delivery of fluid prereduced anaerobically sterilized media; and screw-capped prescription bottles for the cultivation of anaerobes. Colonies of Bacteroides melaninogenicus were easily identified and counted by this method. Other anaerobic bacteria have also been cultivated successfully.

A procedure for detecting pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides in immune complexes is described. Separation of antigen from immune complexes is achieved by electrophoresis at 56 degrees C.

Yolk sac suspensions infected with the Legionnaires disease bacterium (LDB) were plated onto 17 different bacteriological agar media. The LDB grew only on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 1% Iso Vitale X and 1% hemoglobin (MH-IH). This medium was subsequently analyzed to determine the components required to support growth of the LDB. L-Cysteine hydrochloride can replace the Iso Vitale X reagent, and soluble ferric pyrophosphate can replace hemoglobin. A new medium, F-G agar, was formulated incorporating these chemicals. Different cultures conditions (oxygen tension, temperature, and pH) were also evaluated. The LDB grew optimally at 35 degrees C under 2.5% CO2 on the F-G agar adjusted to pH 6.9. When infected tissues were inoculated onto both F-G agar and MH-IH, the F-G agar produced colonies of the LDB more rapidly and in greater numbers than did MH-IH.

NH4+ caused a dose-related, rapid, and reversible inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin release by isolated rat islets. It also inhibited glyceraldehyde-, Ba2+-, and sulfonylurea-stimulated insulun secretion. NH4+ failed to affect glucose utilization and oxidation, glucose-stimulated proinsulin biosynthesis, the concentration of ATP, AD, and AMP, and the intracellular pH. NH4+ also failed to affect the ability of theophylline and cytochalasin B to augment glucose-induced insulin release. However, in the presence and absence of glucose, accumulation of NH4+ in islet cells was associated with a fall in the concentration of NADH and HADPH and a concomitant alteration of 86Rb+ and 45Ca2+ (or 133Ba2+) handling. These findings suggest that reduced pyridine nucleotides, generated by the metabolism of endogenous of exogenous nutrients, may modulate ionophoretic processes in the islet cells and by doing so, affect the net uptake of Ca2+ and subsequent release of insulin.

Reproduction and genetics of the goat are reviewed with a view of increasing their contribution to mankind. The goat contributes most in tropical regions (within 30 degrees of the equator). The most important product from the goat is milk with meat a close second. Other products are minor. Reproductive rate is a problem only with the Angora goat, but increased reproduction with any type of goat would contribute to improved efficiency. Also, a knowledge of the reproductive phenomenon is necessary for effective management. Genetic studies of goats are limited, but this should not limit improvement programs. Excellent genotypes for producing milk and fiber are available, but adaptation to tropical conditions is needed. Even within temperature regions, there is little evidence of progress in breeding for milk production. Little has been done on the development of the goat as a meat animal. Also, research on crossbreeding for milk or meat production is limited.

Intravenous pretesting with radiocontrast media (RCM) was performed in 204 RCM-sensitive patients considered for repeat contrast radiography. Group 1 had vague histories of prior anaphylactoid reaction and negative pretests, and 2 of 41 (4.9%) had reactions upon contrast radiography. Groups 2 to 5 had definite histories of prior anaphylactoid reaction. Group 2 had the radiographic study cancelled: 18 of 21 (85.7%) had positive pretests. Group 3 had positive pretests and underwent contrast radiography, and 9 of 15 (60%) had reactions despite premedication. Group 4 (no premedication) and group 5 (diphenhydramine premedication) had negative pretests, but 11 of 53 (20.7%) and 3 of 71 (4.2%), respectively, developed reactions (p less than 0.001). The reaction frequency in group 3 (posivie pretest) of 12 of 18 (66.7%) was greater than that in groups 4 and 5 (negative pretest) combined (14 of 124 (11.3%), p less than 0.001). Intravenous pretesting identified a high-risk group and diphenhydramine premedication decreased the frequency of reaction in patients sensitive to radiocontrast media.

The diverse hormonal and vascular medications are studied in the way of their mechanism of action, of their efficiency and their side effects on the mother as well as on the fetus. Neither definite argument, nor important statistical study has been made after elimination of all genetics and chromosomic anomalies. beta-mimetic, alphablocking and progesterone medications are the most efficient and certainly the less dangerous for the fetus.

During a 7 1/2 year period pneumococci were isolated from body fluids of 124 patients at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford -72 with pneumonia, 26 with meningitis and 26 with other serious infections. Eighty-one (65%) of the patients were over 50, and 33 (27%) were over 70 years old. Of the 124 pneumococcal strains 104 (84%), including 23 (79%) of those from patients who died, belonged to types included in the vaccines successfully used in South Africa and in Papua New Guinea. The relative frequencies of types in the Oxford series and in a larger British series agreed closely with those found in a recent survey of 3644 bacteraemic pneumococcal infections in 10 American cities. Any polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine licensed for use in the United States is thus likely to be relevant to the situation in Britain.

The effect of adult splenectomy on the expression of suppressor and amplifier T cell activity was examined with respect to the serum antibody response to Type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III) by using a sensitive radioimmunoassay. Suppressor T cell activity, as measured by the degree of low-dose paralysis induced, was not impaired in the least by splenectomy; however, amplifier T cell activity was almost completely eliminated within 7 days after splenectomy. These findings indicate that suppressor T cell activity is not confined solely to the spleen, the major site of antibody synthesis after immunization with SSS-III, and that the spleen may be an important site for the generation and/or maintenance of amplifier T cell activity.

A simple immunoprecipitation--dissociation technique for large scale purification of antibodies is described, which comprises selective denaturation of the antigen and recovery of the antibody fraction by exclusion chromatography at low pH. Its use is illustrated by the purification of antibodies to pregnancy zone protein. A purification factor of about 60 was achieved. An antigen consumption electroimmunoassay was also developed which permits quantitative determination of the antigen binding activity of antibodies with a given specificity. The methods have general application.

Conditions for desorbing a DNP carrier from its immunoadsorbent were studied in various hydro-organic media at different pHs and temperatures, including the sub-zero range. It appeared that DNP--anti-DNP interaction is the result of a balance between various bonds and the best result (95% yield) was obtained in hydro-organic solvent at high pH and +30 degrees C.

1. The effect of the extracellular calcium and magnesium concentrations and calcium ionophore, X-537A, on the frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic potentials (MEPSPs) was studied in cockroach leg muscle fibres. 2. The frequency of MEPSPs increased as the calcium concentration was increased from 0.1 to 10 mM. In the presence of 10 mM magnesium, however, raising the calcium concentration from 0.1 to 1 mM slightly depressed the frequency. In saline containing elevated potassium (20.8 mM), increasing the calcium concentration produced a much higher frequency than that in the normal potassium saline (10.8 mM) in the absence of magnesium. Raising the extracellular potassium concentration was without effect unless the bathing solution contained calcium. 3. The frequency of the miniature potentials was reduced as the magnesium concentration was raised from 0 to 10 mM, depending on the presence of calcium ions. On the contrary, a slightly increased frequency was observed in the low calcium saline as the magnesium concentration was raised from 1 to 10 mM. The reciprocal relationship between calcium and magnesium and the time course of the effect suggest that both ions act at the same surface sites in the presynaptic membrane. 4. X-537A elicited a transient increase in frequency followed by a fall of the frequency to a very low rate. Further application of the ionophore was without effect. The effect of X-537A on the spontaneous release of transmitter at the insect neuromuscular junction was comparable with that on the spontaneous acetylcholine release in vertebrate neuromuscular junctions.

Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from untreated mice and from mice treated with thioglycollate medium (TA), proteose peptone medium (PP), or a suspension of streptococcus A cell wall material (SA). The biochemical and secretory properties of these cells in long term cultures (up to 2 wk) were compared. TA-elicited macrophages contained more protein, lactate dehydrogenase, lysosomal hydrolases, and in particular, more plasminogen activator than the other cells studied. All types of macrophages studied were found to release considerable amounts of lysosomal hydrolases (beta-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, alpha-mannosidase, and acid phosphatase) into the medium. Release was independent of phagocytosis and must, therefore, be regarded as true secretion. In both elicited and nonelicited macrophages, the rates of lysosomal enzyme secretion were virtually identical in the presence and in the absence of serum, and they were not enhanced by increasing serum concentrations. Lysosomal enzyme secretion in macrophages appears to depend on protein synthesis, since it was blocked by low concentrations of cycloheximide which neither affected cell viability nor lowered the intracellular enzyme levels. The amounts of lysosomal hydrolases secreted were highest in TA-elicited macrophages. The rates of secretion of PP- or SA-elicited and of nonelicited macrophages were about one-fourth of that of the TA-elicited cells. This difference, although significant, is much smaller than that observed for the secretion of plasminogen activator which was 20-50 times higher in TA-elicited cells. Acid glycosidases were also found in the peritoneal lavage media used for cell harvesting from both treated and nontreated mice. This indicates that active secretion of lysosomal hydrolases may be an in vivo property of the macrophage.

W3/25 antibody is the monoclonal product of a hybrid cell resulting from the fusion of a mouse myeloma cell line with spleen cells from a mouse immunized with rat thymocytes. Pure clones have been derived, and segregants free of parental myeloma chains have been isolated. Previous studies have shown that this antibody recognizes a subpopulation of T cells among rat thoracic duct lymphocytes. In the work reported here, three T-cell functions were assayed after separating rat thoracic duct lymphocytes on the fluorescence-activated cell sorter on the basis of labeling with W3/25 antibody. Two of the functional activities appeared to be completely segregated by this procedure. Thus, helper cell activity for an anti-hapten plaque-forming cell response was confined to the labeled population, whereas the allogeneic suppressive effect produced in a parental vector F1 adoptive transfer was mediated by cells in the unlabeled fraction. The third function, graft-versus-host activity, was almost entirely contained within the labeled subpopulation. It is concluded that the antigenic determinant recognized by the monoclonal antibody W3/25 is a differentiation marker for T-cell functional subpopulations.

The present studies demonstrate that antisera directed against Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 is opsonic for group B streptococci type III in a neutrophile-mediated bactericidal assay. Specificity was demonstrated by the observations that group B streptococci type III and S. pneumoniae type 14 adsorbed the opsonic activity of anti-S. pneumoniae type 14 antisera. Group B streptococci strain 090R (devoid of type antigens) and S. pneumoniae type 3, did not remove the opsonic activity of anti-S. pneumoniae type 14 serum. In vivo studies using a suckling rat model of neonatal group B streptococcal type III sepsis demonstrated that antisera directed against S. pneumoniae type 14 was highly protective.

In vitro cultures of mouse bone marrow cells, maintained for periods up to 7 wk, were shown to contain cells able to repopulate irradiated hosts with T and B lymphocytes. The lymphocytes were fully functional and there did not appear to be any gross restriction of their receptor repertoire. The cultured cells reconstituted irradiated semiallogenic hosts without evidence of graft-versus-host disease, suggesting that culture of donor marrow might be a useful preliminary to transplantation when tissue matching is incomplete.

Lipolytic activity was studied in gastric aspirates of 13 premature infants of birth weight 1,050 to 1,786 gm. All infants received a diet of infant formula fed by gastric tube. Gastric aspirates were collected after irrigating the stomach with 2 to 5 ml sterile saline before regular feeding. Lipolytic activity, tested with doubly labeled 3H glyceryl-14 C tripalmitin substrate, was 55.6 +/- 11.7 n mol/min/ml (range 4.2 to 140). The lipolytic activity had a pH optimum of 5.4 and produced partial glycerides (mono and diglycerides), glycerol, and free fatty acids. Lipolysis was inhibited by bile salts. Our findings show that in premature infants, as in adults, digestion of dietary fat starts in the stomach. Since bile salt concentrations are low in premature infants, the amphiphilic reaction products formed (monoglyceride and FFA) could play a significant role in the stabilization of lipid emulsions.

Healthy human subjects received single and multiple oral doses of flunitrazepam. Absorption and disposition were first order and reproducible from administration. The oral doses were virtually completely available to the liver, and elimination from the body occurred entirely via metabolism. Assuming the liver to be the sole eliminating organ, hepatic blood clearance and extraction ratio were approximately 0.235 liter/hr/kg and 0.154, respectively. Steady-state blood volume of distribution averaged 3.76 liters/kg in the single-dose studies. Terminal exponential half-lives from the single- and multiple-dose studies (different subjects) averaged 13.5 and 19.2 hr, respectively; these differences were not due to clearance changes but were entirely attributable to variations in volumes of distribution.

A selective nonisotopic assay was used to investigate the digoxin hydrolysis rates at 37 +/- 0.1 degrees over the pH 1.1--2.2 range. The colorimetric method adopted is based on the use of a xanthydrol reagent after extraction with chloroform. The spectrofluorometric method specified in the dissolution test for digoxin tablets was nonspecific because of digoxigenin interference. Digoxin hydrolysis followed specific acid hydrolysis, and K values of the apparent first-order reaction varied from 0.0357 to 0.0027 min-1 over the pH range used. The effect of the dissolution medium on digoxin stability during the dissolution tests of the tablets also was studied. Water (the BP medium) and 0.6% HCl (the USP medium) were compared using the fluorometric method and the xanthydrol method. In the USP medium (pH 1.3), no hydrolysis was revealed by the fluorometric estimation whereas the xanthydrol method showed about 74% hydrolysis. In water, the two methods revealed no hydrolysis. The extent of hydrolysis after 1 hr in the USP medium was studied using three brands of digoxin tablets of differing dissolution characteristics. The fast dissolving brand showed relatively more hydrolysis than the slow dissolving tablets.

The cumulative theophylline transfer rate across 10-cm everted rat intestinal sacs incubated at 37 degrees in pH 7.4 Krebs phosphate buffer was determined. A suspension of ditheophylline succinate ( a potential prodrug of theophylline) and a solution of theophylline at equimolar concentration were evaluated to determine the magnitude of the difference between the cumulative theophylline transfer rates from the two preparations. A linear concentration dependency for the rate across the intestinal wall was evidenced. The theophylline formation rate from ditheophylline succinate suspended in pH 7.4 Krebs buffer at 37 degrees followed apparent zero-order kinetics. The observed difference (fourfold) between the cumulative transfer rates estimated for the theophylline solution and the ditheophylline succinate suspention was attributed to the prevailing theophylline concentration in the mucosal solutions. The biopharmaceutical implication of these observations are discussed.

Camazepam, 5 mg/kg iv, was injected in rats and mice to study its distribution in the blood and brain. Peak blood levels were about 0.9 microgram/ml in rats and 0.6 microgram/ml in mice. Peak brain levels were about 1.5 microgram/g in rats and 0.8 microgram/g in mice. The apparent blood half-life of camazepam was 9 min in mice and 20 min in rats.

The effect of sodium metabisulfite and cysteine on the oxidation of epinephrine in weak alkaline solutions was studied. The fluorescent intensity of the reacting mixture also was measured. Sodium metabisulfite in 2 x 10(-3) M NaOH at concentrations lower than 3 x 10(-5) M had no effect on epinephrine oxidation; however, in concentrations from 5 x 10(-5) to 3 x 10(-4) M, it greatly accelerated this process. Its inhibitory action appeared only in concentrations greater than 5 x 10(-4) M. The mechanism of these reactions also was explained. Cysteine in 2 x 10(-3) M NaOH inhibited the oxidation of epinephrine even in concentrations of 7 x 10(-5) M.

It has previously been shown that neuroleptic drugs block an apparently inhibitory influence of dopamine on cholinergic interneurons in striatum, thereby increasing acetylcholine turnover. In this study, systemic administration of the neuroleptic, fluphenazine, decreased the acetylcholine content in the striatum but not the neocortex of rats killed by focussed microwave irradiation. The effect was observed with doses of fluphenazine as low as 0.05 mg/kg, and was also seen after two other neuroleptics, spiroperidol (1 mg/kg) and haloperidol (4 mg/kg). In contrast, neither fluphenazine nor haloperidol pretreatment had any effect on the high affinity accumulation of choline by striatal synaptosomes. These observations suggest that after administration of dopamine receptor antagonists the release and metabolism of acetylcholine in the striatum is increased, but that a compensatory increase in choline uptake does not occur, thereby resulting in a temporary decrease in acetylcholine concentration. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that acetylcholine synthesis is regulated differently in the striatum than in other brain regions.

The acute administration of levorphanol, morphine, anileridine, methadone, cyclazocine and pentazocine was found to increase brain levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol sulfate (MOPEG-SO4) in rats. Drug-induced increases in brain levels of this norepinephrine metabolite were dose-dependent and peak drug effects generally occurred 1 hr after intraperitoneal injection. Six to 8 hr after opiate agonist or partial agonist administration, MOEG-SO4 levels returned to control values or below. The narcotic effect appeared to be stereospecific, since high doses of d-methadone and dextrorphan produced either no change or only minimal increases in brain MOPEG-SO4 levels when compared with saline-treated controls. The relative potency of the analgesics tested in producing increases in brain MOPEG-SO4 levels appeared to correlate reasonably well with the ability of these drugs to produce other characteristic pharmacological effects. The drug-induced increases in brain MOPEG-SO4 levels were antagonized by naloxone. The rate of disappearance of MOPEG-SO4 from the brains of animals treated with pargyline was not decreased by the opiate agonists or partial agonists tested indicating that these drugs did not inhibit the acid transport process. These results indicate that the production of an increase in brain norepinephrine turnover is a specific component of the pharmacological actions of narcotic analgesics.

When tracheas were isolated from rats pretreated with isoproterenol (ISO) or terbutaline, they were found to be considerably less sensitive to the relaxant action of ISO than tracheas which were isolated from saline-pretreated rats. The dissociation constant (Kb) for the propranolol-beta receptor complex was determined to be up to 400-fold larger in the tracheas isolated from beta agonist-pretreated rats (1.1 +/- 0.1 X 10(-6) M) than in tracheas isolated from saline-pretreated rats (3.0 +/- 0.3 X 10(-9) M). The longer the duration of pretreatment and the higher the dose of ISO or terbutaline used, the more attenuated was the response of tracheal smooth muscle to ISO, and the greater was the Kb for propranolol-beta receptor complex. These findings provide strong evidence which shows that desensitization, which occurs as a result of in vivo pretreatment with beta agonist drugs, results from pronounced reduction in this affinity of the beta receptors for beta agonist drugs. We observed that the in vivo treatment of rats with aminophylline (Amino), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, did not affect the responsiveness of their isolated tracheas to either ISO or Amino. In addition, the responsiveness to Amino was determined in tracheal preparations taken from rats desensitized to ISO in vivo. The response to ISO was attenuated and the Kb for the propranolol-beta receptor complex was elevated (1.1 +/- 0.1 X 10(-6) M); however, Amino was half as effective in these tissues as in the saline control tissues. It is postulated, therefore, that the intracellular enzymes controlling the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate may be affected by the ISO-induced desensitization process, but are not affected by pretreatment with Amino.

The enhancement of asynchronous muscarinic ganglionic firing which follows a preganglionic nerve stimulus volley by high frequency repetitive conditioning stimuli was studied in the rat isolated superior cervical ganglion. Muscarinic afterdischarge which occurred in chlorisondamine-blocked ganglia was enhanced for up to 1 hr after a 40 Hz conditioning volley lasting 7.5 to 30 sec. Enhancement did not occur when release of acetylcholine was blocked by reducing the calcium in the modified Krebs' solution or when magnesium or manganese chlorides were added to the saline during the conditioning period. Metabolic inhibitors, dinitrophenol, sodium azide and ouabain, blocked the enhancement process but not the asynchronous muscarinic firing. Phenytoin, 10(-6) M, did not reduce the enhancement of firing. Dopamine, 5 X 10(-5) M, had no effect on muscarinic afterdischarge, but dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, 5 and 10 X 10(=3) M, caused a 43 and 53% increase in the maximum amplitude of afterdischarge. Dibutyryl cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate had no effect on post-tetanic enhancement or afterdischarge in concentrations up to 1 X 10(-3) M. A working hypothesis is proposed: following a conditioning stimulus, a prolonged postsynaptic change occurs which results in an increased responsiveness to muscarinic agonists, and this change probably involves a metabolic reaction since it is reduced by metabolic inhibitors. Evidence to support the concept that dopamine is a modulator of enhancement in the rat superior cervical ganglion was not obtained.

1. Renal bicarbonate reabsorption was measured in thirty new-born dogs 2-27 days of age. Plasma bicarbonate was varied in the puppies by exchanging their blood with blood containing high levels of bicarbonate and low levels of chloride.2. The exchange transfusion resulted in increases of plasma pH, P(CO2) and bicarbonate in the puppies without changing plasma sodium and potassium or glomerular filtration rate (g.f.r.) and body weight.3. There was no tubular reabsorption maximum (T(m)) for bicarbonate and reabsorption values as high as 50 muequiv/ml. g.f.r. could be attained. No animals excreted bicarbonate at plasma levels below 25 mM and some animals had plasma bicarbonate threshold values in excess of 40 mM.4. Bicarbonate reabsorption increased as arterial P(CO2) rose (r = 0.62) but this was due to the rise of filtered bicarbonate since (a) there was no correlation between arterial P(CO2) and bicarbonate reabsorption when factored by filtered bicarbonate and (b) lowering arterial P(CO2) by mechanical hyperventilation did not reduce bicarbonate reabsorption corrected for filtered load.5. Inhibition of renal carbonic anhydrase by acetazolamide (50 mg/kg) resulted in an inhibition of bicarbonate reabsorption of only 4.5 muequiv/ml. g.f.r. (less than 20% of the total). Even with renal carbonic anhydrase inhibited, there was no bicarbonate T(m) and bicarbonate reabsorption values as high as 40 muequiv/ml. g.f.r. could be attained.6. There was good correlation (r = 0.82) between inhibition of sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption during renal carbonic anhydrase inhibition. However, with carbonic anhydrase inhibited, there was no correlation between arterial P(CO2) and bicarbonate reabsorption.7. These results demonstrate that tubular bicarbonate reabsorption mechanisms in the new-born dog are as efficient as those reported for the adult as long as body fluid and plasma sodium and potassium levels are carefully maintained.8. The results are also consistent with a bicarbonate reabsorptive mechanism explained either by direct ionic bicarbonate reabsorption or by hydrogen ion secretion with diffusion of carbonic acid.

1. An apparatus for intragastric titration has been devised and its validity tested. Both when attached to a beaker simulating a pouch and when attached to a pouch whose secretion was suppressed by infusing cimetidine, the apparatus accurately measured added acid when the endpoint setting was between pH 3.0 and 9.0. At pH 2.0 and 1.0 with liver extract and at pH 1.0 with saline, the amount of acid added was markedly underestimated.2. In dogs with vagally denervated pouches, during stimulation by I.V. infusion of histamine or pentagastrin, the rate of acid secretion as measured by intrapouch titration was uninfluenced by changes in luminal pH between 2.0 and 9.0. The apparent decrease in acid secretion at pH 1.0 could be shown to be due entirely to artifact in that no change in acid secretion was found when the gain in mass of acid was simultaneously measured by using a non-absorbable dilution indicator to measure volume gain and titration of samples to pH 7.0 to measure acid concentration.3. During stimulation of acid secretion by solutions of liver extract or of L-histidine instilled into the pouch, the rate of acid secretion was found to increase markedly as pH was increased from 3.0 to 9.0 thus confirming our earlier findings.4. We conclude that while stimulation of acid secretion by topical stimulants is highly dependent on luminal pH, secretion increasing as pH increases, stimulation by parenteral agents such as histamine and pentagastrin is not influenced by luminal pH in the range from pH 1.0 to 9.0.

Glutamine uptake by rat renal brushborder vesicles occurred via two distinct saturable processes with Km values of 0.145 and 8.5 mM which were stimulated by both ionic and sodium gradients with a pH optimum of 6.8--7.1. Glutamic acid uptake also occurred by a two-component system with Km values of 0.016 and 3.60 mM. Both components were stimulated specifically by a sodium gradient. The low Km system for glutamic acid had a pH optimum of 7.2--7.4. Glutamine entry at 0.06 mM was inhibited by a variety of amino acids at 3 mM, including dibasic amino acids, glycine, valine, and phenylalanine. Glutamic acid entry at 0.06 mM was inhibited 20--30% by 3 mM phenylalanine, valine, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, and glutamine. No metabolic alteration of glutamic acid was observed on incubation with membrane vesicles, but glutamine was significantly hydrolyzed to glutamic acid upon prolonged incubation. Hydrolysis of glutamine was negligible at 15 sec incubation which was employed for measurement of initial rate of entry. These studies provide support for the existence of an uptake system in the brushborder of the renal proximal tubule cell capable of handling the reabsorption of glutamine normally present in glomerular filtrate.

A retrospective review of 20 cases of testicular neoplasia in cryptorchid patients is presented. These cases serve to emphasize the need for more effective diagnosis and management of the undescended testis. The various clinical presentations, diagnostic modalities, prognostic indicators, and types of management are reviewed. Due to its inaccessibility and array of clinical presentations, the intraabdominal testies tumor continues to be a diagnostic challenge. Strict attention to diagnostic cues and adherence to the management practices presented here would hopefully result in an overall decrease in testis tumors in the post-pubertal male.

The effect of soft-tissue trauma was studied in dogs. Following injuries to the hind leg an aggregation of thrombocytes in blood and trapping in the lung was noted. Injury was initially followed by leukopenia and later by leukocytosis. Early hemolysis of red cells was observed. The injury was accompanied by complement activation. Its possible relation to hemolysis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased insufflation pressure is discussed.

A case of utricular dilatation in a child with recurrent urinary tract infection and associated genitourinary anomalies is presented. The embryology of the utricle and the relationship of the dilated utricle to the müllerian duct regression factor are discussed. Clinical sequelae, diagnosis and management are outlined briefly.

A beta-adrenergic blocking activity of perhexiline was compared with that of propanolol. In the Langendorff's preparation of rabbits, canine heart-lung preparations, open-chest dog preparations and hind-limbs of dogs, perhexiline failed to block isoproterenol-induced changes in cardiovascular functions, which were effectively blocked by propranolol. These data suggest that perhexiline is not a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent.

The blood plasma gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGTP) activity was studied in 133 patients with macrofocal myocardial infarction, in 40 patients with microfocal myocardial infarction, in 30 patients with angina pectoris, and in 75 patients with cardiosclerosis and congestive cardiac failure. The activity of the enzyme increased in most patients with macrofocal myocardial infarction and in less than half of those with microfocal myocardial infarction beginning with the 3rd or 4th day, reached maximum by the 6th to 8th day of the disease, and then returned to normal levels in various lengths of time. In all patients with angina pectoris and acute left-ventricular failure the activity of the enzyme remained normal. It may be assumed from the results of the study that determination of GGTP activity in dynamics may be mainly employed in the diagnosis of macrofocal myocardial infarction, particularly after the first days of the disease. The enzyme test is hardly suitable for differential diagnosis between microfocal myocardial infarction and angina pectoris.

In 1973 two physicans' assistants (P.A.'s) were employed on a cardiothoracic surgical service at Emory University Hospital. In 1974 our initial experience with these paramedical personnel was presented to this Association. Since that time eight additional P.A.'s have been added to our service. They are now employed in four hospitals of the Emory University Woodruff Medical Center. New guidelines and regulations have been imposed at both the state and federal levels regarding P.A.'s, and their role in our center has become rather well defined. With over 1,700 cardiac cases and 600 thoracic cases per year to cover on our service, the P.A. has assumed a position of increasing importance both in operating room assistance and in preoperative and postoperative care. Since the university has maintained a constant number of residents and fellows during this interval, P.A.'s have filled needs of expanded clinical service in the various hospitals. In the pediatric and community hospitals associated with a university, the P.A. now functions as a junior house officer. In our university center, with a large resident staff, their role has become narrowed with definite guidelines. A Credentials Committee now governs the hiring of all P.A.'s by the University. When properly utilized and supervised, the P.A. can be a vital member of the cardiothoracic team. This report details our experience with P.A.'s for the past 5 years--culminating in a staff of ten P.A.'s working on our service in four types of hospitals within our university medical center.

To examine the role of the oxygenator in the postperfusion lung syndrome, we studied 16 patients undergoing aorta-coronary bypass with a bubble oxygenator and 14 similar patients with a membrane oxygenator both before and for 2 days after the operation. To maintain the same pulmonary artery occluded pressure and hemoglobin level at the end of the surgical procedure, significantly more blood was required in the bubble than in the membrane group. Postoperative pulmonary dysfunction in the bubble group was characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and lung water. The increase in lung water was present after bubble oxygenation on three successive measurements, whereas there was no increase in lung water above control value at any measurement time in the membrane group. The bubble group had a significantly greater increase in PVR at the immediate postoperative study time than did the membrane group. PVR returned to control value for the duration of study. These differences in lung water and PVR measurements may be related to greater blood component trauma with a Travenol bubble oxygenator than with a membrane lung.

In studies in the isolated rat heart that were designed to optimize the composition of the infusion conditions for a cardioplegic protective solutuin, we have observed a complex relationship between the duration and volume of infusion and the extent of tissue protection. Our results would indicate that solutions, such as that formulated at St. Thomas' Hospital, which are based on extracellular electrolyte content, afford (after a brief equilibration period) a constant degree of protection, irrespective of infusion volume or duration. In contrast other solutions, such as the Bretschneider solution, which have extremes of electrolyre concentration, are associated with a complex dose-response relationship. In the latter instance, infusion of small volumes for short durations affords an increasing degree of protection against ischemia. Increasing the infusate volume may result in a progressive loss of protection. Excessive infusion may lead to an exacerbation of ischemia-induced damage. Our studies suggest that the relative patterns and rates of re-equilibration of various ions, especially sodium and calcium, during infusion may play a major role in determining the efficacy of the infusate.

Career patterns and practice correlates of 143 New Health Professionals (NHPs) educated at one institution are studied to determine similarities among different types of practitioners (Health Associates and Nurse Practitioners). Employment since graduation has been high with low job turnover. Nurse Practitioners (NPs) are found most often in metropolitan areas, while over 50 per cent of Health Associates (HAs) are employed in rural settings. More NPs work in hospitals than HAs, who have a higher rate of employment in private practices, HAs are also involved in a wider range of medical specialties than NPs. In terms of patient care, HAs see more patients than NPs and also have larger primary care caseloads. From a functional perspective, only minimal differences are found in comparing the activities of the practitioners. Most NHPs have high job satisfaction, although HAs anticipate a high rate of job turnover; no differences were found in levels of perceived responsibility nor in the amount of supervision in patient care. Although there were only small differences in the activities of the two groups, numerous contextual and practice correlates were found to differentiate the NHPs, a finding which argues against the current practice of conceptualizing NHPs as a single group.

The metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde proceeds in the liver via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS), whereas catalase plays no significant role. ADH is localized in the cytosol, required required NAD+ as cofactor and exhibits a pH optimum in the alkaline range and a Km of less than 2 mM for ethanol. Conversely, the MEOS resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, requires NADPH and O2, is inhibited by CO, and exhibits a Km of about 10 mM for ethanol. The microsomal system also metabolizes higher aliphatic alcohols such as butanol which is not a substrate for catalase. Moreover, it could be separated from ADH and catalase by column chromatography. The MEOS exhibits a variety of properties similar to those of other microsomal drug metabolizing enzymes and is characterized by inducibility of its activity following chronic alcohol consumption, which suggests the involvement of the microsomal system in the adaptive enhancement of ethanol clearance commonly observed in alcoholics.

Substrate oxidation by rat kidney slices regulates renal ammoniagenesis from glutamine. At concentrations close to those expected in plasma, lactate alone, or combined with other renal fuels, inhibits ammoniagenesis markedly; glucose and citrate decrease ammoniagenesis slightly. However, lactate, citrate, and glucose inhibit ammoniagenesis of kidney slices from acidotic rats less than ammoniagenesis of kidney slices from control rats. Lesser inhibition of ammoniagenesis is seen also when acidotic slices rather than control slices are incubated in the presence of all the tested substrates combined in the same medium. In addition to decreasing the ammoniagenesis of renal slices from control rats, the presence of lactate causes an augmented accumulation of glutamate. In contrast, adding lactate to acidotic slices does not increase glutamate accumulation nearly as much. When glutamate is substituted for glutamine in the medium, lactate still decreases ammonia production, but to a lesser extent with acidotic slices. Changes in medium pH from 7.0 to 7.8 have no, or only small, overall effects on net renal slice ammonia production from glutamine under any of the circumstances tested. We conclude that lactate alone and combined with other substrates decreases ammoniagenesis primarily at the glutamate dehydrogenase step and that slices from acidotic rats are relatively resistant to substrate mediated inhibition.

To evaluate the effect of starvation, oral and i.v. nutriments, and hypothyroidism on the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to 3,3', 5-triiodothyronine (T3) in the rat and mouse, an in vitro system for assessing T4 conversion to T3 by fresh liver homogenates was used. A 2-day starvation in the rat reduced hepatic T3 generation from T4 by 47% +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SE) in six separate experiments and also impaired the metabolism of 125I-r-T3. Administration of carbohydrate (CHO) and amino acids (P), but not lipid (L), significantly increased T3 generation above values observed in the starved rat. The mean serum glucose concentration was similar in all nutriment-infused groups, but serum insulin was significantly greater in the CHO- and P-infused as compared to the L-infused rats. These findings suggest that CHO and P, but not L, are important modulators of hepatic outer ring thyronine deiodination in the rat, perhaps due to increased intracellular glucose. Hypothyroidism in the rat induced by thyroidectomy and congenital secondary hypothyroidism in the dwarf mouse resulted in a striking decrease in hepatic conversion of T4 to T3. This decrease was restored to normal by the daily s.c. administration of physiologic doses of T4 (1.5 microgram/100 g) or T3 (0.5 microgram/100 g) for 14 days, and was increased above normal following treatment of normal rate with greater than physiologic doses of T4 (3microgram/100 g) or T3 (1 microgram/100g). In vitro hepatic conversion of T4 to T3 is, therefore, dependent upon thyroid function. Since 2-days starvation in the rat was associated with decreased serum concentrations of T4, T3, and TSH, and hypothyroidism resulted in decreased conversion of T4 to T3, the effect of a constant 2-day infusion of physiologic doses of T4 or T3 in the starved rat on the in vitro deiodination of T4 was assessed. Thyroid hormone replacement did not enhance the conversion of T4 to T3 in the starved rat. These observations suggest that the starvation-induced decrease in hepatic generation of T3 from T4 is not due to hypothyroidism and that the mechanism(s) of the decreased T3 production observed in starvation and hypothyroidism is different.

The effect of redox potential was studied on the growth of the following aerobic microorganisms: Candida utilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens. The action of oxidizing agents (K3Fe(CN)6, KIO3, K2Cr207 and KMnO4) and reducing agents (ascorbic acid, sodium thioglycolate, K4Fe (CN)6 and Na2S2O3) on the growth rate was investigated. K3Fe(CN)6, ascorbic acid, sodium thioglycolate and K4Fe(CN)6 were found to be suitable for buffering the Eh of the medium. The potential could be shifted by 50--200 mV by adding various reducing and oxidizing agents. The rate of growth of C. utilis, Bac. megaterium and Ps. fluorescens did not depend on the potential value.

The activity of alcohol dehydrogenase was compared in subcellular fractions of Torulopsis candida grown on glucose ("glucose cells") and on hexadecane ("hexadecane cells"). Two groups of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) were found to be present in the cells: (1) soluble ADH located in the cytosol and (2) ADH bound to the membrane structures and located in the mitochondria and other cell structures. Soluble ADH of "glucose cells" actively dehydrated all alcohols tested from C2 to C16. Ln "hexadecane cells", the activity was low or absent. ADH bound to the cell structures dehydrated mainly C5--C16 alcohols; the activity of these ADH was almost by an order of magnitude higher in the "hexadecane cells" as compared to the "glucose cells" (in contrast to soluble ADH). The character of changes in the activity of ADH toward various alcohols in the course of physiological adaptation of the yeast to oxidation of glucose and hexadecane suggests that both soluble and bound ADH contain at least two ADH, one of which is specific to lower alcohols and the other to higher alcohols.

The paper confirms the existence of a peroxide mechanism involved in oxidation of iron and manganeses by the most typical iron bacteria growing at neutral acidity of the medium. Oxidation of bivalent iron and manganese is accomplished by the simultaneous action of catalase and hydrogen peroxide produced in the respiratory chain in the course of oxidation of organic substances. Catalase performs the peroxidase function in these processes. The possibility of these biological reactions to occur and the necessary conditions have been studied in vitro. Possible variants of iron and manganese oxidation by iron bacteria are discussed, including the conditions for "symbiotic" oxidation of manganese by mixed cultures of microorganisms.

In a field study comprising 678 patients with arterial hypertension efficacy and tolerance of the stable combination VKB 105 consisting of 10 mg Pindolol (Visken) and 5 mg Clopamid (Brinaldix) were investigated. Treatment with 1--2 tablets of VKB per day resulted in a successful therapy in 94% of all patients corresponding on the average to a reduction in blood pressure to 145/85 mm Hg within 14 days. In mean arterial pressures ranging between 120 and 170 mm Hg a positive linear relationship between the individual initial value and the hypotensive effect of the combination could be observed. A controlled omission trial disclosed qualitatively the respective contribution to the effect of the two components Pindolol and Clopamid. With a systematic case control of the serum potassium under the combined therapy with VKB 105 and during a monotherapy with Clopamid and antihypokalaemic effect of Pindolol could be demonstrated diminishing the tendency for potassium loss. The result revealed a far-reaching potassium neutrality of diuresis-depending stimulation of renin by the beta-receptor blocker. In 61 patients altogether subjective side-effects could be recorded, such as vertigo (5%), palpitations (2.8%), fatigue (2%), insomina (1.9%), nausea (1.7%) and vomiting (0.8%). Laboratory controls gave no indication for clinically relevant changes.

Mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO deficient in their utilization of DL-valine have been found to have lost their capacity to utilize DL-alanine and L-proline. Use of conjugal and transductional mediated gene transfers have established the chromosomal location of this gene and also its pleotropic function in the induction of the D-amino acid oxidase, involved in the oxidative utilization of DL-valine, DL-alanine and L-proline. These point mutations are clustered in a single locus designated as Val D and mapped around the 19th minute on the chromosome.

4 cases of accidental fenfluramine poisoning in children are reported. Excitation, coma, convulsions, tachycardia, mydriasis, nystagmus, and rubeosis of the face were the most important signs. They appeared 30--60 min after ingestion, and some of them lasted for several days. 2 children had severe trismus and therefore had to be given muscle relaxants before intubation and gastric lavage became possible. These observations agree well with  informations collected in our poisoning control center and with previously published data. Less than 5 mg/kg of body weight are toxic, 5--10 mg/kg may produce coma and convulsions, and the smallest lethal doses were 28,7 and 33,3 mg/kg. Early gastric lavage, good monitoring of the vital functions and, if necessary, administration of anticonvulsive drugs, beta-blocking agents, lidocaine, chlorpromazine, and artificial ventilation and cardiac defibrillation are the most important therapeutical measures.

Within the last 10 years the indications for a therapeutic regimen with beta-blocking-agents have been differentiated: coronary heart disease with angina pectoris (interval regimen), essential hypertension, especially in younger persons; hyperkinetic heart syndrome; thyreotoxikosis, symptomatic therapy; heart rhythm disorders, extrasystolic or tachysystolic; neurologic-psychiatric diseases. The development of the newer beta-blocking-agents has effected different kinetic data (f.i. long acting effects of Tenormin) and a increased cardioselectivity. The recommendations for the therapeutic regimen have to be outlined to the underlying diseases. The sensitivity against the drugs depends on remarkable individual differences, with the consequence of a careful and low dosage in the beginning in each case. The side-effects of beta-blocking-agents are presumably: bradycardia, bronchospasm, fatigue, adynamia, myocardial insufficiency, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoglycemia, hypotension.

Graft-versus-host disease, a complication of allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation, involves primarily the skin, liver and intestines, but may also be associated with pneumonia. To determine the relation of graft-versus-host disease with pneumonia, we evaluated the autopsies of 59 allogeneic and two autologous recipients and 74 control patients with various pulmonary diseases, who had not received a bone-marrow transplant. Lymphocytic bronchitis, characterized by lymphocyte-associated necrosis of the bronchial mucosa and often the submucosal glands, was present in 12 of 20 patients with Grade 2 or greater graft-versus-host disease but in only three of 39 with Grade 0 to 1 disease (P less than 0.0005). Onset of respiratory disease correlated with the time of onset of graft-versus-host disease. Patients with lymphocytic bronchitis had a higher incidence of bronchopneumonia and acute bronchitis of the lower respiratory tract. Lymphocytic bronchitis did not occur in the controls and appears to be a component of graft-versus-host disease that leads to bronchopneumonia, probably through destruction of the mucociliary apparatus.

Progesterone reinitiates meiotic maturation in Xenopus oocytes. Evidence is reported which indicates that the steroid acts at the level of the cell surface and suggests that an induced change of Ca2+ distribution triggers in turn a cascade of cytoplasmic events including protein synthesis and germinal vesicle (nucleus) breakdown. These novel features of steroid hormone action in amphibian oocytes are discussed in relation to presently accepted views of the mechanism of action of steroid hormones in somatic cells.

The effect of diazepam was evaluated on spontaneous activity and drug- and electrically-elicited inhibitions of neuronal activity. Doses of diazepam which did not change spontaneous firing rates markedly enhanced GABA-mediated inhibitions in rat cerebellum in situ and in tissue cultures of rat hypothalamus. The effects of diazepam were readily reversible, and could be antagonized by picrotoxin; no effect on glycine or norepinephrine-induced inhibition was seen. It is concluded that actions of diazepam are mediated, at least in part, by a specific increase in GABA-mediated inhibition in the central nervous system.

The Bohr factor, phi = delta log Po2/deltapH, was determined at various levels of hemoglobin O2 saturation (SO2) in fresh whole blood of the duck. Plasma pH was varied by either changing PCO2 of the blood at constant base excess (CO2 Bohr factor, phiCO2) or by addition of NaHCO3 and HCl at constant PCO2 (fixed acid BOHR factor, phiAH). No differences were found between phiCO2 and phiAH at SO2 levels between 20 and 85%, and there was no saturation dependence of the Bohr factor, its average value being -0.44. It is concluded that in whole blood of this bird species CO2 exerts no direct effect on the O2 affinity of hemoglobin.

A method for measuring the net acid base exchange in an isolated rat diaphragm preparation is described. Particular attention is paid to monitoring the functional status and maintaining optimal diffusion conditions. A steady net acid efflux of the order of 250 n mole/g-min is found in the resting state. This increases following a series of isometric contractions. In the resting state the total measured lactate + pyruvate efflux was found to be less than the net acid efflux. The net acid efflux increases following a sudden decrease in pCO2 and decreases or reverses following a sudden increase in pCO2 or a decrease in external bicarbonate. The net base loss during a period of 1 h following the exposure to high (20%) CO2 represents a large fraction of the predicted total bicarbonate generated within the fibres by non-bicarbonate buffers. This indicates that the effects of intracellular non-bicarbonate buffers can be transmitted to the external solution following a change in pCO2. The most plausible explanation is that passive bicarbonate ion movements are responsible. Values of the 'apparent PHCO3' have been calculated and vary under different conditions from a value of 1.3 X 10(-7) to 1.9 X 10(-6) cm-s-1.

The damage to DNA by the hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 was investigated. A DNA fragment of known sequence of the lactose promoter-operator region was used as a substrate for modification by aflatoxin B1. The DNA was incubated with aflatoxin B1 in crude mammalian liver extracts or with purified microsomes. Treatment of the DNA incubated in the complete system with either 1 M piperidine or 0.1 M NaOH at 90 degrees revealed alkali-labile lesions in the DNA. The exact location of the cleavage site was determined by comparison of the length of the cleavage products with the known sequence on polyacrylamide gels. The lengths of the cleavage products were the same as those produced by alkali-induced breakage of the same sequence of DNA that had been modified with dimethyl sulfate. The major cleavage products of the aflatoxin B1-modified DNA were at positions of guanine and the minor cleavage products were at positions of adenine. These studies show that modification of DNA by aflatoxin B1 creates alkali-labile sites at positions of guanine and, to a lesser extent, adenine.

A study was made of some binding and physico-chemical properties of a special estrogen-binding protein of liver cytozol in sexually mature female and male guinea pigs following its partial purification by means of ammonium sulfate sedimentation, gelfiltration and ion-exchange chromatography. The given protein proved to bind estradiol (E2) with Ka of the 10(7) M-1 order and possessed a rather marked hormonal affinity specificity. Under unbalanced conditions its complexes with E2 were capable of rapid dissociation. Characteristics of the size of protein molecules were: molecular weight--about 60000, Stokes' radius--3.2 nm, sedimentation coefficient--4.6, friction coefficient ratio--1.18. Protein E2-binding activity was reversibly depressed in the presence of high salt concentrations, decreased in the presence of dithioerythritol and on heating at the temperature of over 50 degree C. The optimum E2 binding was observed at pH 7.3--7.7. There were no significant differences in the properties of protein from the liver of males and females. A conclusion was drawn on a close similarity between the given protein of guinea pigs and of a special estrogen-binding protein of the liver in male rats detected by the authors earlier.

6'-(N-Dansyl)aminohexyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside binds specifically to the lac carrier protein in cytoplasmic membrane vesicles isolated from Escherichia coli. Binding can be induced by substrate oxidation (generation of an electrochemical gradient of protons), by potassium efflux in the presence of valinomycin (generation of a potassium diffusion potential), and by passive, carrier-mediated lactose efflux. We show that in all three cases the number of binding sites is temperature dependent. Binding is maximal and constant above 20 degrees ; it decreases between 20 degrees and 10 degrees . Oxidation of substrate (D-lactate) leads to the development of an electrochemical gradient of protons across the membrane (interior negative and alkaline), which is composed of interconvertible electrical and chemical gradients. We show that both the electrical potential across the membrane and the chemical difference in proton concentrations across the membrane are independent of temperature between 5 degrees and 25 degrees . We show that the number of binding sites induced by D-lactate oxidation depends on pH. At both 25 degrees and 5 degrees , the number of binding sites increases from pH 5 to pH 6.5, remains constant between pH 6.5 and 7, and decreases from pH 7 to pH 8. In contrast, the number of binding sites induced by passive, carrier-mediated lactose efflux is independent of pH between pH 5.5 and pH 8. From these findings, we conclude that the pH- and temperature-dependent effects on the number of 6'-(N-dansyl)aminohexyl-1-beta-thio-D-galactopyranoside binding sites have different origins. The pH dependence of binding is energy linked and reflects in part the pH dependence of the electrochemical gradient of protons across the membrane generated by substrate oxidation. The temperature dependence is not an energy-linked phenomenon. The decrease of the number of binding sites at low temperature probably reflects the aggregation of the lac carrier protein with other membrane proteins. This aggregation takes place as a consequence of the conformational disorder-to-order transition of the membrane lipids and the concomitant preferential segregation of the lac carrier protein in the membrane domains containing the disordered lipids.

Oxygen binding by trout Hb IV has been investigated as a function of pH up to 10 atmospheres (1 MPa) of pure O2. The results bring out an extreme proton-oxygen linkage, which gives rise to a Root effect. They are discussed in relation to the function of the hemoglobin as an oxygen pump. The system is of special interest as providing a prototype of a macromolecule acting as a transducer by coupling two allosterically linked reactions.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels of coated vesicles from porcine brain (mean 76% coated vesicles) show three major proteins (180,000, 125,000, and 55,000 daltons) that account for 73% of the total protein. Preparations consisting predominantly of coats (65%) have less of the 55,000-dalton protein. Clathrin (180,000 daltons) comprises 40% of the protein of a coated vesicle. Conditions of 2 M urea, 0.25 M MgCl2, or pH 7.5 disrupt the coat and solubilize clathrin. Solubilized clathrin reforms coat structures after dilution of urea or MgCl2. High-pH-solubilized clathrin reassembles after dialysis against buffer at pH 6.5 containing dithiothreitol (5 mM). Reassembled coats are predominantly clathrin.

We have established a clonal cell line, PC-G2, from an experimentally induced rat pheochromocytoma. Administration of nerve growth factor to PC-G2 causes a 4- to 8-fold induction in the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase [tyrosine 3-monooxygenase; L-tyrosine,tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase(3-hydroxylating); EC 1.14.16.2]. The response is elicited in a dose-dependent fashion, at concentrations above 0.1 microgram/ml. Antiserum to nerve growth factor inhibited the induction of tyrosine hydroxylase. Dexamethasone enhances the nerve growth factor-mediated elevation of tyrosine hydroxylase. After 3--4 days of exposure to nerve growth factor the maximal induction of tyrosine hydroxylase is seen, although a significant increase can be observed after 24 hr. In contrast to the PC-12 cell line (derived from the same tumor), in which neurite outgrowth occurs in response to nerve growth factor, there is no morphological change or alteration in growth rate of PC-G2 cells after exposure to nerve growth factor.

Kainate, a conformational analogue of glutamate, blocks synaptic transmission across the giant synapse of the squid. In the presence of blocking doses of kainate, impulses continue to propagate into the nerve terminal, but action potentials are slightly reduced in size and the subsequent hyperpolarization is greatly diminished. Kainate depolarizes the postsynaptic axon. Since the depolarizing action of kainate is confined to the postsynaptic membrane, it appears that kainate can combine with the receptors which are normally activated by the transmitter. This results in a diminished effect of the transmitter released by a presynaptic nerve impulse.

Intracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase provided a basis for morphological identification of inhibitory interneurons belonging to the recurrent collateral network of the Mauthner cell. Their axons dilate to form unusually large bulbs surrounding the axon cap. The morphological appearance of these bulbs as well as intracellular recordings at their level indicate that they behave as nodes and serve as a final source of current for electrical inhibition of the Mauthner cell. The axon of each interneuron gives rise to two different groups of fibres which are respectively fitted for the mediation of electrical and chemical inhibitions of their target cell.

Previous observations have pointed out that treatment with amphetamine during pregnancy produces behavioral modifications in adulthood. In order to elucidate some possible brain biochemical mechanisms that could explain the behavioral changes observed we have determined the endogenous content of brain dopamine and noradrenaline, the in vivo rate of conversion of tyrosine-C14 in such amines and the activity of tyrosine-hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in catecholamines biosynthesis. We did not observe modifications in the endogenous content of dopamine and noradrenaline but did observe an increase in the conversion rate of tyrosine-C14 in such amines and also in the tyrosine-hydroxylase activity. These results indicate that treatment with amphetamines during fetal age produces catecholamine metabolism modifications that persist throughout adulthood, although the influence of behavioral modifications of the mothers cannot be ruled out. The relationship with behavioral changes is discussed.

The norepinephrine (NE)-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP in incubated tissue slices of mouse lung was inhibited by chlorpromazine (CPZ) and to a lesser extent by haloperidol. In particulate lung fractions both agents blocked dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase to a greater degree than the NE-responsive enzyme. Again CPZ was more potent than haloperidol. Acute injections (1/2--8h) of the neuroleptics usually resulted in lower steady state levels of pulmonary cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP following rapid (0.5 sec) tissue inactivation by microwave irradiation. On a subchronic injection schedule, the in vivo levels of pulmonary cyclic AMP tended to increase.

Any reasonable evaluation presupposes a precise question. Furthermore it is necessary to eliminate all factors of disturbance, which are able either to simulate or to mask a result of evaluation. The most important of these factors is the psychiatrist himself. Therefore, experimental designs have to taken in account the factor psychiatrist. Criteria of the effects of any drug must be relevant with regard to comparison of two or more drug effects. The reproduciability of criteria is very desirable, but a wish-fulfilment under the most circumstances. Because criteria should be independent and mutually exclusive, all scales like the Hamiltons one are not suitable for evaluation. Finally one should use as few criteria as possible. Models of evaluation are described for the most frequent questions in connection with clinical trials in psychopharmacology.

For 2 weeks 40 volunteers received either 5 mg diazepam, t.i.d., or 10 mg chlordiazepoxide, t.i.d., and placebo. A choice reaction test, two coordination tests, and an attention test were administered to the subjects on the 14th day of each treatment. Thirty minutes before the tests, the subjects ingested either alcohol., 5g/kg or a placebo drink, incombination with the last capsule. After the test the subjects rated the quality of their treatment as placebo, tranquilizer, or stimulant. The psychological tests taken before the treatments were Eysenck's EPIC-NESI, Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), and Cattell's 16 PF inventory. A multiple regression analysis was computed. Personality factor scores found to be associated with a strong effect of the benzodiazepines were 16 PF's A, C, L, N, and Q, and EPIC's E. The effect of alcohol was associated with a high score of 16 PFs B factor. Personality factors associated with "placebo reactors" and nonreactors were investigated, as well. Those subjects on placebo indicating their treatment to be active were classified as "placebo reactors". A discriminant analysis revealed that 16PF's O and I factors discriminated effectively "placebo reactors" from nonreactors, and EPIC's SE and 16 PF's L factor nonreactors from "reactors".

This is a report of a symposium and training seminar of the "Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Methodik und Dokumentation in der Psychiatrie" (AMP). Video-recordings of two psychiatric interviews were shown during the seminar and rated by the participants using the AMP-3-Scale (Psychopathology). Aim of the seminar was a rater training and the preparation of an expert standard rating. These videotapes with the corresponding standard ratings will enable the different clinics using the AMP-System to compare their rating behaviour. The process of achieving an expert standard rating is described. The training seminar was followed by a symposium during which a series of lectures was presented on "Standardized Assessment in Psychiatry", The different working groups of the Association reported about their work and future prospects of the Association were discussed.

In 20 psychotic patients with frequent hallucinations and/or actual delusional experience a possible antipsychotic action of the opiate antagonist naloxone (N-allyl-noroxymorphone) was investigated, using a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. 18 of these patients were not treated with neuroleptic drugs; 13 suffered from an acute episode of schizophrenia. Psychopathological changes were assessed by the use of the IMPS-scale and of a symptom-specific rating scale (VBS). Intravenous injection of naloxone (in most cases 4.0 mg) induced a reduction of psychotic symptomatology (especially hallucinations) in the majority of patients. Compared with placebo this effect reached statistical significance within 2-7 hours after injection. From this result a possible involvement of endogenous ligands of opiate receptors in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia may be concluded.

Five patients suffering from choreo-athetotic syndromes of different genesis were treated with the benzodiazepine-derivative Ro 06-9098/000 (7-Nitro-1(methylmethoxy)-1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2 H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one). The existing hyperkinesias could be well influenced in four cases of male patients, sufficiently in one case of a female patient. The sedative effect, accompanied by a muscle hypotonia appearing simultaneously under the medication, did not represent and essential limiting factors at the chosen dose of 5--20 mg/die. The observed successes in therapy point at the result and effect of benzodiazepine derivatives on extra-pyramidalmotoric hyperkinesias which got little attention until now.

Changes in neurotransmitter concentrations, which are brought about by the administration of neurotropic pharmaceuticals to albino rats at the time of differentiation of the brain, may have a lasting effect upon the reactivity and adaptability of adult animals to environmental factors and give rise to specific patterns of behavior. 1. Pargyline, when administered neonatally, resulted in a reduction of learning power, decrease in the power of retention, as well as reduction of the decision-making ability. 2. Reserpine gave an improvement of learning power, but simultaneously decreased both the power of retaining what had been learnt and the decision-making ability. 3. Pyridostigmine gave a marked improvement of adaptability which was evidenced in higher learning power, greater retentiveness, and better decision-making ability.

It proved possible to make lesions which interrupted the striatonigral GABA-containing pathway in the rat brain without causing concomitant damage to the nigrostriatal dopamine containing system. Estimations of striatal concentrations of dopamine (DA), dihydroxyphenyl-acetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) inducated that these lesions had no influence either on normal striatal DA turnover or on the enhancement of DA turnover induced by neuroleptics. Behavioural experiments suggested a motor output function for the striatonigral pathway.

Two behaviors related to nonreward (omission of water in an enclosure where the rats were habituated to drink) were studied. The time spent licking the bottles during water omission and the time spent drinking during a subsequent 5-min drinking session (water available) were recorded. The drinking session was performed 30 min after the water-omission session. Rats subjected to water omission showed an enhanced drinking time that varied with the length of the water omission session, with the motivational state of the animals, and with the previous number of water-omission sessions. Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, and meprobamate (i.p., 30 min before water omission), increased the time spent licking the empty bottles, but failed to abolish subsequently enhanced drinking. However, some of our data suggested that minor tranquilizers weakly reduced the increased drinking induced by nonreward, despite their direct stimulation on water drinking. It is proposed that either minor tranquilizers are devoid of general antifrustration activity or nonreward-induced frustration and nonreward-induced drive enhancement may not be correlated.

Eight patients are presented who demonstrate many of the pulmonary complications seen in the prune-belly syndrome. The patients are divided into two major groups: Group I includes pulmonary hypoplasia; Group II includes lobar atelectasis and pneumonia. The etiology, pathogenesis, and radiographic features of these complications are discussed. Pulmonary complications become more important as renal dialysis and transplantation spare more of these patients from an early uremic death. Prompt recognition of the type and the extent of pulmonary disease in patients with the prune-belly syndrome may lead to increased survival.

Arachidonic acid stimulated guanylate cyclase activity about two fold in homogenates of mammary glands obtained from midpregnant mice; effects of arachidonic acid were observed during incubation periods between 5 and 20 minutes. Stimulatory effects of arachidonic acid on guanylate cyclase activity were observed when 10 to 100 microgram arachidonic acid was added to the reaction mixtures (150 microliter). When 250 microgram or more arachidonic acid was added to the reaction mixtures, the activity of guanylate cyclase was inhibited. Other fatty acids including linoleic acid, linolenic acid and oleic acid also stimulated guanylate cyclase activity but neither arachidic acid nor stearic acid had an effect. The arachidonic acid stimulation of guanylate cyclase activity was abolished by incubation with indomethacin and aspirin, thus suggesting the arachidonic acid effect may be carried out via the prostaglandins. A variety of prostaglandins, however, at several concentrations did not stimulate guanylate cyclase activity when added to the reaction mixtures. The failure of the prostaglandins to have an effect may be due to several reasons which are discussed.

Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona was found to survive for at least 42 days in a typical New Zealand soil under simulated winter field conditions. The soil was markedly acidic with a pH of 5.5 and survival times were not reduced even when its water content was only 23%. The values of both these parameters are considerably less than previously recorded for the survival of leptospires in soil. Two methods were used to recover leptospires from the soil microflora. One was the culture of a membrane filtrate in EMJH media with or without contaminant-suppressing additives and the other was the direct inoculation of soil-washings into hamsters. Both techniques proved to equally sensitive. It was estimated that following the addition of 5 X 10(8) leptospires to the soil samples less than 2 X 10(4) were present after six weeks.

A novel potentiometric assay was employed to evaluate the effects of beta-fluorination of phenethylamine (PEA) on brain MAO substrate preference. Through the use of the substrate selective MAO inhibitors clorgyline (type A) and Deprenyl (type B), F-PEA and F2-PEA were found to be preferred substrates for MAO type B. Since various degrees of fluorination of the parent PEA molecule proportionally decrease the pKa values, as well as their substrate activity for MAO, it is suggested that the protonated form of PEA and its respective mono and difluoro analogs are the preferred substrate forms for catalysis by brain MAO.

Gamma-glutamyl transferase distribution was studied in 10 ewes and 10 lambs; in both groups kidney was the most active organ, followed by pancreas, liver and lungs. In kidney and liver, GGT was bound mainly to cellular structures. Blood GGT activity of 48 lambs was 44 +/- 11 iu/litre and 33 +/- 7 iu/litre of 45 ewes.

Portions of closed jejunal biopsies from the dog were homogenised and their organelles separated by isopycnic centrifugation on continuous sucrose density gradients. The distributions of marker enzymes for the principal organelles were determined using highly sensitive assay procedures. The following organelles, with assayed marker enzymes and modal densities between brackets were characterised: peroxisomes (catalase, 1.21); brush borders (zinc-resistant alpha-glucosidase, leucyl-beta-naphthyl-amidase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, 1.20); lysosomes (N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, alpha-mannosidase, 1.19); mitochondria (malate dehydrogenase, 1.18); endoplasmic reticulum (Tris-resistant alpha-glucosidase, 1.16); basal-lateral membranes (5'-nucleotidase, 1.11) and cytosol (lactate dehydrogenase). Homogenisation in isotonic sucrose containing digitonin (0.12 mmol/litre) selectively disrupted lysosomes and increased the equilibrium density of brush border and basal-lateral membranes. This procedure will be used to study the subcellular pathology of naturally occurring intestinal disease in the dog.

Measurements of branchial cavity water pressures and flow patterns, arterial blood PO2 and pH, and oxygen utilization and uptake have been made in undisturbed, free swimming sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus. Although the jaws are degenerate and the oral apparatus is highly modified for feeding, gill ventilation is nonetheless powered by a buccal force pump and an opercular suction pump common to most bony fishes. The reduced spiracles play little or no role in gill ventilation. In sturgeon in which water intake through the ventrally located mouth was experimentally eliminated, a condition which may often develop when these fish forage in mud and sand on river substrates, effective ventilation of the gills was maintained with water drawn into the branchial cavities in a retrograde fashion solely through permanent openings in the upper regions of the opercular slits. O2 uptake and transport also remained at control levels. It is suggested that this unusual alternative mode of gill ventilation in the sturgeon represents an important respiratory adaptation to bottom dwelling and feeding.

Hemoglobin-ligand interaction was studied in maternal and fetal sheep blood as a function of oxygen saturation. pH was changed by varying CO2 concentration (CO2 Bohr effect) or by addition of NaOH or HCl at constant PCO2 (fixed acid Bohr effect). For maternal blood, CO2 Bohr factor was -0.41 at 50% oxygen saturation, increasing in magnitude at lower saturation and decreasing in magnitude at higher saturation. For fetal blood, CO2 Bohr factor was -0.45 at 50% oxygen saturation, unchanging at lower saturation and decreasing in magnitude at higher saturation. Fixed acid Bohr factor was relatively saturation independent with a value of -0.36 for fetal blood and -0.27 for maternal blood. The pH-independent effect of molecular CO2 on oxygen affinity was markedly saturation dependent being greatest at low oxygen saturation. The CO2 effect was greater in maternal blood than fetal blood. However, the magnitude of the saturation dependency of Bohr factor is not great enough to have major physiological significance in oxygen transfer across the sheep placenta.

At high altitude, in resting conditions, no differences have been observed between High Altitude Natives (HAN) and acclimatized Sea Level Natives (SLN) in AaDO2, aADCO2 or venous admixture. In acclimatized SLN, AaDO2 is smaller than at sea level because of: (1) The minor effect on arterial oxygenation of the probably constant venous admixture. (2) The reduction of VA/Q inequality as shown by a smaller aADCO2. In HAN, DLCO is greater than in SLN; the contribution of DM or VC in this difference remains unsettled, mainly because of the difficulties of measurement of DM and VC in HAN suddenly exposed to acute hyperoxia. In SLN, in acute hypoxia, DLCO increased transitorily. Asynchronous mechanisms of adaptation to high altitude are evoked.

The oxygen affinity in the blood of adult Dorset sheep with HbB was studied by determining several oxygen equilibrium curves under different conditions of pH and PCO2 by a method that allowed strict control of pH, PCO2, and HCO3- concentration over the entire curve. Nomograms and equations were derived that allowed the estimation of the oxygen saturation in a sample of blood in the range 0 to 100%, either from pH, PCO2 and PO2, or from PO2 and known P50. The advantage of this approach is that no assumptions about the shape of the oxygen equilibrium curve need be made (i.e. the Hill parameter, n, is not required to be constant), since the entire curve was measured.

A modified analytical isoelectric focusing procedure on polyacrylamide gel slabs, offering increased resolving capacity, has been developed for identification of six subtypes of the most common alpha-1-antitrypsin (A-1-AT) phenotype, Pi M. Combination of commercial Ampholine and other ampoteric substances, so called separators, produces pH plateaus, determined by the properties of the the additatives. Equilibrium is reached after extended focusing time, whereby stabilization of A-1-AT through alkylation is advantagous. The significance of this high resolution method for applications of the Pi system in genetic studies, and the general relevance of the modifications for other analytical purposes are discussed. A new nomenclature recommendation is presented.

Diamine oxidase (DAO) was purified from amniotic fluid. The activity was separated in two DAO fractions with pI values of 5.8 and 4.0. Molecular weight were found to be 245,000 and 485,000, respectively, with subunit molecular weight of 110,000. This indicated that they probably are dimer and tetramer of the same DAO subunit. The enzyme was active against putrescine and histamine and was strongly inhibited by carbonyl group reagents. A Ping Pong Bi Ter enzyme reaction mechanism is probable. The diamine, with one amino group protonized, is suggested to be responsible for interaction with the enzyme.

A procedure is described for the determination of plasma or serum haemoglobin employing the peroxidase activity of the haemoprotein using 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethyl-benzthiazolinsulphonate-6) as chromogen. The method gives equal results for free haemoglobin, methaemoglobin and haemoglobin complexed to haptoglobin. It is designed to measure haemoglobin in the range 0--12 mumol/l. The peroxidase activity of myoglobin is similar to that of haemoglobin, whereas haemin in free solution, bound to haemopexin or to albumin (methaemalbumin) shows much lower activity. The precision within run is satisfactory, +/- 5%.

The results obtained and the laboratory methods used for the isolation of viruses and bacteria from Malaysian children with acute respiratory illnesses seen in a private clinic are described. Of the 65 children studied virus isolations were obtained from 26 children, bacteria from 10 and both virus and bacteria from another 5. The agents isolated were influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus pyogenes.

Abnormalities of testicular descent represent the most common genitourinary anomaly in men. Many aspects of testicular maldescent remain controversial. The etiology of the undescended testis is still not known, but results of experimental work in rats strongly support the hormonal theories. Distinction between the truly undescended testis and the retractile testis remains a problem, making retrospective analysis of previous data confusing. Newer aspects of diagnosis of nonpalpable testes include the human chorionic gonadotropin test, herniography, venography and arteriography. Routine aspects of surgical therapy have changed little in recent years, although newer techniques, such as microsurgical procedures and innovative scrotal anchoring methods, are now available. Malignant tumors and infertility are the most worrisome complications. Evidence is presented to suggest that prognosis is related not only to choice of therapy but also to its timing. The recent evidence for Sertoli cell dysfunction, if substantiated may resolve some of the controversies.

The frequency of HLA-B5 (66%, n = 38) in Japanese patients with Takayasu's disease was significantly higher than in controls (32%, n = 160). The level of significance was x2 = 13.53, P less than 0.0005 and corrected P less than 0.009.

Microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia pahangi were killed by the chewing action of the cibarial and pharyngeal armatures and other papillae and spines in the fore-gut of mosquitoes. The proportion of ingested microfilariae that were killed was largely dependent on the presence and shape of the cibarial armature. Anopheles farauti No. 1 and Anopheles gambiae species A and B have well developed cibarial armatures and killed 36 to 96% of the ingested microfilariae. Culex pipiens fatigans has a poorly developed cibarial armature and killed only 6% of the microfilariae. Aedes aegypti and Aedes togoi lack cibarial armatures but have the remaining fore-gut structures. They killed only 2 to 22% of the microfilariae. The significance of these observations in relation to the control of filariasis with diethylcarbamazine is discussed.

The potential of cells from the Peyer's patches (PP) of normal adult DBA/2 Tru mice (DBA/2) to induce a graft-versus-host reaction when injected into (C57BL/6 Tru x  DBA/2 Tru)F1 hybrid (B6D2F1) mice was studied. The injection of 10(6) to 10(7) DBA/2 PP or spleen cells i.p. into neonatal F1 mice produced a striking splenomegaly. Comparable doses of parental PP or spleen cells injected into a rear footpad of adult F1 mice also induced a marked enlargement of the draining popliteal lymph node. In addition, PP cells were also capable of producing a lethal runting syndrome when injected i.v. into sublethally irradiated adult F1 recipients. In all assays, injection of syngeneic B6D2F1 cells had little or no effect. Treatment of the DBA/2 PP cells with anti-theta serum and complement abolished their capacity to induce splenomegaly in neonatal F1 mice. The graft-versus-host reaction activity of the PP cells could also be eliminated by thymus deprivation of the donor DBA/2 mice. These data are contradictory to previous findings in which it was observed that mouse PP cells were unable to induce graft-versus-host reaction.

Seventeen patients with aplastic anemia or acute leukemia received transplants from donors who had major ABO incompatibilities. Antibody titers were decreased by plasma and whole blood exchanges prior to marrow infusion. All 17 patients were successfully engrafted, and there was one possible rejection in the patient with the highest pretransplant anti-A IgG titer. Nine of 17 patients are currently alive. A review was carried out of transplants performed in Seattle between HLA-matched siblings with aplastic anemia and leukemia. Two hundred forty-six evaluable patients with ABO-compatible donors were compared with 46 with minor ABO-incompatible donors. There was no effect of minor ABO incompatibility on graft rejection, incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease, or survival.

The effect of phosphate buffer on the course of pH, ATP, and 2,3-PDG of CPD red blood cells stored at three temperatures was observed. Basic phosphate at an equilibrated level of 10 mM (as iP) maintained pH above 7.00 and ATP and 2,3-DPG above 70 per cent of initial value in cells stored at 37 C for 24 hours. In contrast however, at 25 and 4 C no buffering was obtained with basic phosphate concentrations up to 50 mM, but values for both ATP and 2,3-DPG were higher in phosphate treated aliquots than in controls throughout storage. When the pH of blood stored at 4 C was adjusted into the range 7.15 to 7.25 with tromethamine and the level of iP raised to 10 mM by addition of Na2HPO4 on day seven, it was found that ATP and 2,3-DPG levels were maintained at 90 and 120 per cent, while control levels fell to 60 and 12 per cent, respectively at 21 days. The process described parallels the normal repair of damaged red blood cells of bank blood that occurs in vivo following transfusion.

The lipoprotein-lipase activity (LPLA) in the abdominal, subcutaneous, adipose tissue was studied in a random sample (n = 69) of 60-year-old men. A new method for the quantification of LPLA was applied. The mean value was 67 mU/g when expressed per gram (wet weight) of adipose tissue. Several subjects within the lower part of the range of adipose-tissue LPLA values had low concentrations of serum-triglycerides (S-TG). There was no correlation between the LPLA and S-TG concentrations in the fasting state. Among the 69 subjects, four had newly detected diabetes mellitus and had significantly lower LPLA in the adipose tissue than the control group. The fat-cell size and the LPLA per gram of adipose tissue were not correlated. Thus, obesity without diabetes mellitus does not imply a low LPLA concentration in adipose tissue. The variation of the concentration of adipose-tissue LPLA in the fasting state in this population was explained only to a minor extent by the variation of S-insulin and blood-glucose parameters, when analysed statistically by a stepwise multiple-regression technique.

A histological study of the postpubertal untreated cryptorchid testis establishes a direct anatomical relationship between Leydig cells and tubular sclerosis, an age-related process ranging from mild fibrosis of the tubular tunica propria to complete tubular hyalinization. Two separate processes are involved. Mild or moderate tunical fibrosis is related to pretubular hyperplastic Leydig cell nodules, while severe tubular sclerosis and hyalinization depends on the development of intratunical Leydig cells, a finding hitherto undescribed. More probing studies are needed to define the mechanisms whereby these abnormal Leydig cells cause tubular tunical fibrosis.

In 11 patients with upper motor neuron bladder paresis due to spinal trauma, 2 patients with lower motor neuron bladder paresis, and 4 patients with multiple sclerosis, alpha-adrenergic blockade with 10 mg Regitine intravenously decreased the maximum urethral closure pressure to an average of 42%. The decrease was most pronounced in a patient with lower motor neuron bladder paresis and a flaccid pelvic floor. Treatment with phenoxybenzamine was found valuable in patients with multiple sclerosis and poor bladder emptying as well as in patients with lower motor neuron bladder paresis. In patients with detrusorsphincter dyssynergia this treatment was of no value.

Detrusor hyperreflexia was found in 54 patients or 14.6% of 369 consecutive patients referred for urinary incontinence and/or genital prolapse during a 2-year period. The dominant symptom was urge incontinence. The urological investigation consisted of a medium fill water cystometry in the supine position. 20 patients (37%) suffered from cerebral or pyramidal nervous disorders. The treatment of choice was pharmacological with parasympatholytica, methantheline bromide (Banthine). The follow-up examinations performed in 33 patients after 6 months treatment showed an improvement rate of 82%. The importance of performing a cystometry in all female patients referred for urinary incontinence is stressed.

The effect of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation on the volume of the urinary bladder in 16 neurologically normal humans without symptoms of micturition disturbances was investigated into. Terbutaline, a selective beta2-receptor-stimulating agent, was tested in 9 persons and isoprenaline, a general beta-receptor-stimulating agent, was tested in 7 persons. After terbutaline the maximum increase in the bladder volume was 10% and on an average around 5%. After isoprenaline the maximum increase in the bladder volume was 15% and on an average around 5%.

The alpha-adrenergic innervation of the functional urethra is a well-known fact, while beta-adrenergic influence is rather unknown until now. We studied the influence of beta-stimulating and beta-blocking agents on the human urethra by the urethral pressure profile (UPP). A decrease of the UPP under orciprenaline sulfate and an increase under propranolol could be mentioned.

Thirty cases of prune belly syndrome with no stillborn deaths seen over a twenty-five-year period at a university pediatric hospital are reviewed and the management, findings, and prognosis discussed.

Fifteen boys with prune belly syndrome cared for over a ten-year period required surgical treatment because of uncontrolled infection and/or progressive azotemia. Five died of renal dysplasia. Primary or staged reconstruction resulted in significant improvement when ureteral reimplantation was combined with tailoring of ureteral caliber.

1. The erythrocyte is suitable as a model of investigating the mechanism of  adaptation as a function of aging. 2. By hemolysis experiments in isotonic solutions of various pH-values changes of the resistance of human erythrocytes during the mechanism of aging in the organism are established. 3. In isotonic alkaline solutions the resistance of the human erythrocytes changes according to the "curve of vitability" of the human organism.

Oxidation of fluorescent substrates--NADPH and 4-dimethylamine chalcone (DMC) by microsomes from liver endoplasmic reticulum was studied after freezing and thawing of these cells organelles. Slow freezing to -25 degrees or quick freezing to -196 degrees did not affect distinctly the rate of NADPH oxidation after thawing, but oxidation of DMC by microsomes was decreased in both cases. Freezing and subsequent thawing of microsomes impaired apparently the terminal sites of electron transfer and/or the systems of hydroxylation, including cytochrome P-450. Slow freezing to -25 degrees impaired microsomes more markedly than quick freezing to -196 degrees.

LDL, fibrinogen and other plasma macromolecules are retained in intima in substantial amounts. In areas where lipid is accumulating a large part of LDL is immobilized possibily by binding to fibrin. Lipid may be deposited from LDL as a result of degradation by a cathepsin in intima.

It is reported on course and problems of the diagnosis of a lupus erythematodes visceralis with epilepsy. In the demonstrated case the initial stage was characterized by the nearly simultaneous appearance of relapsing arthritides and epilepsy. The diagnosis was made in the stage of an acute exacerbation with cardiac symptomatology which began after the medicamentous treatment with diphenylhydantoin. Up to this moment an oligosymptomatic lupus erythematodes visceralis had not yet been diagnosed. Anamnestic data and the laboratory-clinical findings of the further course of the disease proved the actual lupus erythematodes visceralis. It is referred to the necessity of an aimed anamnesis and a determination of the antinuclear factors before every application ofhydantoin derivations when an epilepsy and joint symptomatology are present.

Adenylate cyclase activity as well as intracellular content of sAMP were decreased 2.5-4-fold, as compared with normal state, in plasmatic membranes (PM) of hepatoma 22 and of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma--the tumors characterized by high level- of malignancy. Activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase exceeded distinctly the normal value in all the tumors studied. In less malignant hepatoma 48 the adenylate cyclase activity and content of cAMP were similar to those found in normal liver cells. The guanylate cyclase activity did not differ markedly from values found in normal liver cells in PM of all the tumors studied and in liver tissue of the tumor-bearing animals. Distinct alterations were not found in content of cGMP in the tumors, except of hepatomas 60 and 22, in which the nucleotide level exceeded 2-fold the normal value. The ratio cAMP/cGMP was decreased in the most malignant tumors. At the same time, the ratio was distinctly elevated in tumors with the middle level of malignancy (hepatomas 60 and 61).

Analytical investigations of extracts after acid hydrolysis are in use especially considering benzodiazepine screening methods. The article describes the gas-chromatographic data of 19 hydrolysis-derivatives which are formed by hydrolysis of 12 important 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepines and 17 main metabolites.

The report contains data concerning clinical studies of a new Soviet tranquilizer of benzodiazepine derivative--phenazepam. Treatment of 100 patients gave a good therapeutical effect in 82%. The best results were attained in the treatment of generalized hystero-neurotical states, somewhat less in the group of neurotic states with a prevalence of affective disorders and the less effective in the obsessive-phobic syndrome. On the basis of comparative studies, the conclusion is made that phenazepam is not worse by its psychotropic activity than ativan (lorazepam) and exceeds diazepam (seduxen), most likely because of its myorelaxing action. The drug exerted an expressed hypnotic effect being not less than eunoctin and other eunectics.

In the investigated Candida guilliermondii strain after growth on n-alkanes as the only carbon and energy source 5--10 nMol cytochrome P-450 per g cells (wet weight) could be detected. Cytochrome P-450 and alkane hydroxylase activity was found in the 100 000 xg pellet. Cofactor studies and inhibition experiments revealed the existence of a NADPH-dependent cytochrome P-450 alkane hydroxylase system.

Methotrexate (MTX) followed by citrovorum factor (CVF) rescue was evaluated for its effectiveness in reducing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in lethally irradiated dogs transplanted with bone marrow from unrelated histoincompatible donors. Animals were given no immunosuppressive therapy (group A) or a combined regimen of MTX and CVF (group AMC). These two groups were compared with a group of animals transplanted earlier given MTX alone (group AM). Ainmals in the AMC group lived significantly longer than the A group (p less than 0.05). Engraftment rate, hematopoietic recovery and incidence of GVHD were similar in all three groups. Incidence of early deaths was significant in the AM group (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that MTX combined with CVF increases survival and is an effective posttransplantation immunosuppressive regimen with minimal toxicity.

Endogenous plasma folate binder denuded of folate by dialysis at pH 3, subsequently bound more methylfolate than folic acid, in contrast with the minor unsaturated plasma binder which bound folic acid in preference to methylfolate. On Sephadex DEAE-A50 chromatography 14C-CH3H4PteGlu bound to acid-denuded endogenous binder, eluted like the endogenous binder-radioactivity, labelled in vivo after oral 14C-CH3H4PteGlu. It is suggested that the endogenous plasma folate binder is not identical with the unsaturated binder.

Rats with different levels of blood glucose concentration were exposed to 10 min of complete brain ischemia achieved by compression of neck vessels by a pneumatic cuff. All normoglycemic rats survived the ischemic period and made the best clinical recovery. Hyperglycemic rats died within 12 h. Seizure activity was observed in all animals in this group. Three of eight hypoglycemic rats died between 3 and 16 days. The clinical recovery was less complete than in the control group. Thus, recovery from cerebral ischemia depends upon preischemic blood glucose concentration. Hyper- and hypoglycemia hamper the clinical recovery after transient cerebral ischemia.

The effect of salbutamol (a comparatively selective adrenergic beta2-receptor agonist) on the peripheral platelet concentration was studied before and after the ingestion of either 50 mg metoprolol or 40 mg propranolol. The study was carried out on healthy males volunteers and autologous 51Cr-labelled platelets were employed at the experiments. Salbutamol was infused intravenously over a period of 6 min in a dose of 0.27 microgram.kg(-1). min(-1). Prior to metoprolol and propranolol administration a statistically significant lowering in platelet-bound radioactivity (PBR) was obtained in response to the salbutamol infusions. This salbutamol-induced fall in PBR was completely blocked by propranolol but was left unaffected by metoprolol. It is concluded that adrenergic beta2-receptor stimulation induces a transient lowering of the peripheral platelet count.

beta-Glucosidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were measured with synthetic substrates in peripheral leucocytes, urine and serum from patients with juvenile type of Gaucher's disease. Our findings in urine and serum make it clear that diagnosis by using synthetic substrate is not possible. In peripheral leucocytes reduced level was found for beta-glucosidase activity in patients with Gaucher's disease but also there occurred some overlapping with controls. The possible explanation to these findings are discussed.

A system employing an Ingold glass electrode was shown to give reliable measurements of pH drops in dental plaque in situ (Stephan curve readings). The system was used to demonstrate that mouthrinses of 0.2 per cent aqueous solutions of stannous fluoride reduced the pH drops markedly for at least seven hours. A reduction of the stannous fluoride concentration increased the pH drops and decreased the duration of the inhibiting effect. A commercial toothpaste containing stannous fluoride and stannous pyrophosphate had an effect similar to the 0.2 per cent mouthrinse. It was shown that tin accumulated in dental plaque after application of solutions containing stannous fluoride. About 40 per cent of the amount of tin present in the plaque immediately after the mouthrinse was still retained seven hours later. It is suggested that the reduction in acid formation may be caused by stannous ions adsorbing to the bacterial cell wall thus disturbing membrane transport mechanisms, or through inhibition of enzyme systems essential in the fermentation of sugars. The observed effect may be a part of the mechanism involved in the caries preventive function of stannous fluoride.

The relation of the nucleotide sequences in the message and of the short nucleotide sequence in 3' terminus of 16 S ribosomal RNA was found to differ from statistical expectancy. The observation is interpreted in terms of both the ribosomal interactions and the molecular evolution.

The bacteriological findings in 200 patients with acute maxillary sinusitis are reported. It is concluded that the sampling technique--by antral aspiration--is highly significant in the evaluation of the bacteriological background of sinusitis, whereas the anerobic transport of the sample seems to be of less importance. By aspiration the purulent secretion can be properly separated from the non-purulent secretion. Pneumococci, H. influenzae and anaerobic bacteria can be isolated in about 90% of the patients with true sinus empyema, while sterile conditions are rare.

Highly purified glycopolypeptides HA1 and HA2 were separated from bromelain-released haemagglutinin of influenza virus A/Dunedin/4/73 (H3N2) by gel filtration in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride under reducing conditions. The purity of both glycopolypeptides was proved by extensive studies. Despite the lack of C-terminal end, the isolated HA2 glycopolypeptide displayed some hydrophobic properties.

Two non-productive Epstein-Barr (EB) virus genome-carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines, namely Raji and NC37, were used for studying the effect of UV irradiation on the ability of P3HR-1 EB virus to induce early antigen (EA) formation. In NC37 cells infected with UV-irradiated virus the formation of EA was delayed; thus the slope of inactivation curve based on the early (24 hr) reading was steeper than that based on the late (72 hr) reading. This was not observed in Raji cells. Caffeine did not influence the percentage of EA positive cells in cultures infected with untreated virus; however, the drug exhibited a marked inhibitory effect on EA production after infection with UV-irradiated virus. The sensitivity to caffeine effect decreased more rapidly with time after infection of Raji than of NC37 cells, suggesting a higher degree of readiness of the host cell repair system in the former than in the latter cells. The caffeine effect was merely directed against the synthesis of R (restricted) component of EA; its influence on the D (diffuse) component formation was negligible.

The microdissection technique was used to study otoconial membrane from 30 human infants ranging from newborn to 2 years of age. Both saccular and utricular membranes were quite variable in overall shape. During the neonatal period, the gelatinous layer of the otoconial membrane appears to thicken and become less adherent to the macular surface than in the fetal period. In many infants older than 6 weeks, otoconial membranes were found at autopsy to be completely dislodged from the maculae, with abnormally large saccular otoconia present in four specimens. Fourteen of the infants studied died of sudden infant death syndrome and 16 died of other causes. The incidence of detached otoconial membranes was approximately the same in both groups. Although the majority of these membranes were apparently dislodged post mortem, the present findings suggest that otoconial membranes are susceptible to pathological alteration due to disease or head trauma.

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TEV) were inoculated in young and old chick embryo cell (CEC) and in L-cell cultures at various multiplicities per cell, simultaneously or 17 hr apart. The yield of infective LCMV was inhibited in double infection, most in old CEC with elevated interferon mechanisms, and least in L cells producing no interferon. In young CEC, TEV-induced interferon was stimulated by coinfecting LCMV; LCMV alone never has induced interferon. The reproduction of TEV was little affected. In doubly infected L cells the fluorescent antibody techniques revealed more cells positive for each viral antigen than in single infections, but the yield of LCMV per one antigen-positive cell was decreased. The course of TEV infection in cerebrally infected mice was not changed by co-infection with LCMV. The titre of LCMV in the brains of doubly infected mice was markedly suppressed when compared with LCMV monoinfection. High interferon levels in brains of all mice infected with TEV were not affected by LCMV co-infection.

Western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus strains from the eastern and western United States were compared using two biological markers: antigenic properties measured by cross complement fixation (CF) tests and the size of plaques produced in Vero cell cultures. Slight antigenic differences were discernible on a geographic basis, and all of the virus strains from the West produced significantly larger plaques than the eastern isolates. One virus strain from each region was serially passaged in Culex tarsalis and Culiseta melanura by intrathoracic inoculation. No change in plaque size was detected as a result of mosquito passage. After passage of the eastern strain of WEE virus in C. tarsalis, its mouse brain CF antigen titer was increased to resemble the high CF antigen titer produced by the western strain. However, the antisera titers did not change when tested with this antigen. A cross plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) with the two virus strains before and after passage in mosquitoes failed to reveal any antigenic changes.

Various solvents and kinds of agar and agarose as well as various ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antigen preparations were tested in a search for optimal conditions for the detection of low levels of type-specific influenza antibody in avian sera by gel double diffusion. The best results were obtained with one kind of agarose in a solvent with lowered ionic strength (approx. 0.075 M). A hypertonic solvent usually gave worse or negative results, with the exception of one kind of agarose. In general, agarose yielded better results than agar. The results of immuno-precipitation were affected by the strain of influenza virus used for the preparation of RNP antigen.

Hares (Lepus europaeus L.) infected subcutaneously (s.c.) or per os with Coxiella burnetii and s.c. with Rickettsia slovaca overcame an inapparent infection accompanied by irregular rickettsaemia and distribution of rickettsiae to different organs and variable antibody response. Neither riskettsia could be detected in faeces of infected animals, but C. burnetii was found in the urine of one hare, which died on day 13 post infection (p.i.). Antibodies against C. burnetii persisted for one year of observation period, those against R. slovaca up to the 181st day p.i. Based on the results obtained and data on other lagomorph species, the hare could play an important role as host of C. burnetii and R. slovaca in nature.

Antibodies against H-1 and X14 parvoviruses were found 13.71 and 9.14%, respectively, of 350 sera from women affected by repeated abortions or still-births. On the contrary, only 2.66 and 1.66% of 300 control sera were positive to the two viruses. The difference in the incidence of antibodies appears highly significant (p greater than 0.001). Therefore a possible role of the parvoviruses in inducing abortions or still-births in humans is suggested.

Depression is a medical illness related to an interplay of genetic, biochemical and environmental/experiential factors. Careful diagnosis, using contemporary psychiatric criteria, simplifies treatment by the family physician. Awareness of these criteria may lead to improved selection of candidates for drug treatment and early intervention in recurrent illness. The new nosology in psychiatry avoids much confusion and should take some of the guesswork out of psychiatric treatment in the family physician's office.

Binding of bile salts to food residue was studied in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro experiments, residues of a number of foods were incubated with each of several bile salts at different concentrations and pHs. All food residues tested adsorbed more dihydroxy than trihydroxy bile salts. Bile salt binding increased as bile salt concentration increased and was greater at a low pH. The extent of bile salt adsorption to some food residues could be clinically important. In patients with short ileal resections, we compared the rates of fecal excretion of labelled cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids and of a nonabsorable marker during ingestion of an ordianry diet (approximately 5 g of fiber) and a residue-free liquid diet. Coefficients of bile salt adsorption were calculated. Both bile acids were absorbed more efficiently during the liquid diet. Chenodeoxycholic acid was preferentially bound to the particulate matter of stools of patients eating the fiber-containing diet. It seems possible that dietary fiber could affect the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts in certain patients with ileal resection.

The accuracy and precision of urinary pH determinations using commercially available dipsticks were studied. Two products were evaluated by 17 MT(ASCP) technologists over the pH range 4.5 to 9.0. The study included accuracy, reproducibility, variation among technologists, and variation between products. The results demonstrated considerable variation among technologists, products, and true pH levels in dipstick urinary pH determinations, and that very good or very poor results could be obtained, depending on the true pH level being sampled and on the choice of technologist.

Two dipstick procedures and an automated quantitative urinary nitrite assay were used to study nitrite in 786 samples of urine submitted to the bacteriology laboratory for routine culture and sensitivity testing. Many samples that had more than 100,000 nitrite-reducing organisms/ml and no detectable nitrite were studied. Limited nitrate concentration in urine was not a significant cause of false-negative nitrite results. However, in some urine samples nitrite added in vitro was lost during a four-hour incubation in vitro at 37 C in the presence of more than 100,000 nitrite-reducing organisms/ml. Ascorbic acid, abnormal amounts of urobilinogen, and urinary pH below 6.0 are all possible causes of false-negative nitrite determinations.

Histamine H-2 receptors are thought to mediate gastric acid secretory responses, whereas H-1 receptors supposedly regulate mucosal vascular responses to histamine. In an in vivo chambered canine stomach flap preparation, the H-1 receptor antagonist, tripelennamine, injected intraarterially (22.1 mumol/kg) into the stomach flap reduced histamine-stimulated (1.25 micron/kg/min intravenously) acid secretion by approximately two thirds with a secondary reduction in gastric mucosal blood flow. This antisecretory action does not appear to be due to nonspecific mucosal damage. The H-2 receptor antagonist, metiamide, injected intraarterially (2.5 mumol/kg) also inhibited gastric acid secretion by about two thirds as did intravenously injected metiamide (4.5 mumol/kg), whereas intravenously administered tripelennamine (40.8 mumol/kg) was ineffective as an acid secretory inhibitor. Intraarterial tripelennamine reduced the secretory actions of the H-2 agonist, 4-methylhistamine (2.2 micron/kg/min intravenously), while intravenous metiamide depressed the gastric mucosal dilator responses to the H-1 agonist, 2-methylhistamine (5 micron/kg/min intravenously). Both histamine-receptor antagonists also reversed the systemic circulatory depressor effects of histamine and its analogs. These results suggest the need for reevaluation of inferences based upon the assumed specificity of H-2 and H-1 agonists and antagonists.

The effect of ipecac syrup as an emetic in adults as well as children who had ingested antiemetics or other drugs was evaluated. Adults or children over five years of age were given 30 ml of ipecac syrup followed by 360 ml of water; children aged one to five years were given 15 ml ipecac syrup followed by 240 ml of water. If emesis was not induced within 30 minutes, a second dose was administered. Of 232 patients studied (199 adults and 33 children), 188 (81%) vomited following the first dose, 34 (15%) required two doses and seven (3%) did not vomit. Of 63 patients who had ingested drugs with antiemetic properties, 51 (81%) vomited following the first dose, nine (14%) required a second dose and three (5%) did not vomit. The time from ipecac administration to the onset of emesis in all 232 patients averaged 24.2 minutes. Ipecac was successful in inducing rapid emesis in both adults and children who had ingested antiemetics or other drugs, probably as a result of its irritating effect on the gastric mucosa.

Plasma secretin concentrations and pH in the second portion of duodenum were measured in the fasting state and during duodenal infusion of HCl in five patients with untreated celiac sprue, five celiac sprue patients after gluten-free diets, and five normal subjects. Mean fasting plasma secretin concentrations were insignificantly lower in untreated sprue patients (4.1 +/- 1.4 pg/ml) than in normal subjects (5.7 +/- 0.59 pg/ml). During 30-min intraduodenal infusions of 0.1 N HCl at 0.20 mEqH+/min, mean plasma secretin concentrations were significantly lower in untreated sprue patients (5.8 +/- 1.8 pg/ml) than in normal subjects (25.4 +/- 1.60 pg/ml, P less than 0.01). The increases in mean secretin concentrations over fasting were 2.1 +/- 0.82 pg/ml in untreated sprue patients compared to 19.7 +/- 1.47 pg/ml in normal subjects (P less than 0.01), a ninefold difference. The results indicate that endogenous release of secretin in response to duodenal acidification is impaired in patients with celiac sprue.

The systolic time intervals of the fetal cardiac cycle were studied by means of simultaneous recordings of electrocardiogram (ECG) and ultrasound Doppler cardiogram (DCG) in chronic preparations of fetal rhesus monkeys. Recordings were made under physiologic conditions as well as during various experimental stresses. The pre-ejection period (PEP) showed no significant relationship with heart rate in the unstressed fetuses, but the acceleration of heart rate induced by epinephrine was accompanied by shortening of PEP. The PEP increased with advancing fetal age. The PEP was inversely correlated with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and arterial pulse pressure, but showed a positive correlation with both systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. The PEP also exhibited strong negative correlation with arterial blood pH. the prolongation was essentially the same whether acidosis was of respiratory or metabolic origin. The PEP increased slightly but significantly during nonacidemic hypoxemia; however, there was no correlation between Pao2 and PEP Epinephrine shortened the PEP significantly, whereas the effect of atropine was inconsistent. Alteration of the plasma glucose level by injection of insulin or glucose did not affect PEP. These findings demonstrate that the PEP may be a useful indicator of fetal cardiac performance, reflecting both myocardial contractility and the hemodynamic state of the cardiovascular system.

Withdrawal symptoms frequently follow abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic compounds. In addition to other somatic symptoms, withdrawal-emergent dyskinesias may be observed. "Covert dyskinesia" refers to a masked form of tardive dyskinesia that becomes clinically detectable only after antipsychotic drugs are withdrawn or their dosage is reduced. Withdrawal dyskinesia appears under similar circumstances but disappears spontaneously in 6 to 12 weeks. Cholinergic overactivity and changes in dopamine-acetylcholine balance in the basal ganglia may underlie these withdrawal syndromes. The principal value of the concept of covert dyskinesia is in the secondary and tertiary prevention of tardive dyskinesia through early discovery and treatment.

During the past 25 years psychiatry has increased its understanding of the social context of schizophrenia in four major areas. Reasonable reliability can now be achieved in describing and recognizing many of the acute and chronic syndromes, so that comparability can be achieved between different research teams. Much is now known about the proximate social causes of symptoms and disabilities. The relationship between social and pharmacological treatments is now better understood. A more rational approach to the planning and prescription of services and to the counseling of patients and relatives can be made. Each of these lines of advance promises to lead to further progress in the future.

In a gerontological field-study in Cologne, West-Germany, 1114 subjects of a random sample of elderlies were successively offered three modalities for a medical check-up, which covered a physical examination and a psychiatric interview: 1. in the out-patient department of a psychiatric hospital (Rheinische Landesklinik Köln) (38% of the subjects); 2. in the subjects' home by a psychiatrist of the hospital (13%); 3. by having the general practitioner fill out a questionnaire (21%). There remained a fourth group of subjects who refused any medical check-up (28%). Data on social and economic problems had been obtained for all subjects in a preceding interview. These data were used to find out to what extent selection mechanisms were effective. Results indicate that to a certain extent the modality of the medical check-up chosen by the subject is related to some of the variables analyzed.

In connection with a gerontological research project data on the physical of the persons being investigated were, amongst other sources, also obtained through a mail survey of family doctors. How far survey shortcomings have a distorting effect was studied. The results indicate that a mail survey of family doctors may yield appropriate data even if some of the physicians named by the persons being investigated do not respond.

The effectiveness of the "Berlin Letters for Seniors" (LFS) will be tested by a longitudinal study. Two Measurement Points (MP) are scheduled: 1976 and 1978. The total sample (N = 3000) comprehends two subsamples of receivers and non-receivers. Data were/will be collected by a questionnaire. A preliminary analysis of the MP I data shows that the two subsamples are comparable as to demographic variables and relevant attitudes; so they may serve as experimental versus control group. An examination of what the readers' concept of the LFS was like, proved that though reservation was recognizable approval prevails.

Author examines the suicide-motives of elderly people in connection with stress and describes the Hedri-Mallisons disease, which has a very high suicide-rate.

208 hospitalized patients, nearly 80 years old, were investigated because of risk factors and complicating diseases. Hypertension (58.2%), typical myocardial infarctions (37.2%) and diabetes (45.2%) were twice often as in our comparable cases without stroke. Corresponding we found signs of left ventricular hypertrophy in more than 50% post mortem. The dimensions of heart failure by hypertension are visible in ECG indicating LVH with many dysrhythmias. Early mortality (40%) as survival time are dependent on the size of the stroke. Cardiovascular causes of death were found mainly. The differences to younger patients with brain infarction seem to be only of gradually nature and especially to refer to the more intensive damaged heart.

This retrospective study regarding prosthetic fitting in geriatric amputees showed that only about 50 per cent of the patients could be fitted with a prosthesis. The time interval from the amputation until the patients walked adequately with the prostheses was very long. This was due to problems with the healing of the stump, as well as insufficiencies in the medical organization. An increased coordination of the care of these patients before and after an amputation would improve the whole course of events. It is suggested that the main responsibility for these patients should be transferred to physicians, specialized in long-term care medicine.

Some years will have to pass, until there will be evidence, if application of leaser beam in surgery of Breastcancer, Melanomas or Basaliomas was justified and whether it is possible or not to interrupt or reduce intraoperative tumor cellspread. As an increasing number of surgeons have started to use laser rays in these illnesses, result of laser surgery and those of traditional methods could be compared in a couple of years. Possibly other indications will be outlined in general surgery for the use of laser beside those we have been working out. It may happen that surgeons working with laser beam might bring the method into discredit putting indication not rigorous enough. I should like to remind everybody who starts working with laser rays, to do so with greatest possible care. Collaboration with a technician is recommended. Periodic he should control the machine and handle arising technical problems.

All antidepressants now used have a cardiotropic, for some instances also cardiotoxic effect. This quinidine-like effect prolongs the QT-interval of ECG and can induce reentry and ventricular fibrillation. When quinidine and antidepressants are combined in the same patient the risk of such cardiac complications increases.

Each stage of life is characterized by the prevalence of certain affections; among others, inflammatory diseases of the ear, nose and throat are frequent in old age. Therefore, specific problems of chemotherapy in old age are dealt with in general terms in the introduction, with special stress being placed on the functions of individual organs, mainly of the kidneys, and on questions of disturbed absorption. Inflammations caused by streptococci, requiring at least ten days of antibiotic treatment, always deserve particular attention, and so do staphyloccocal diseases, requiring the selective administration of semi-synthetic pencillines (sioxazol preparations). Penicillin is still the first choice among all antibiotics, penicillin substitutes, to be used in case of allergies, are listed according to their order of value. As anaerobic germs may also be present in the ENT area, the effective modern therapy by means of special antibiotics is also referred to. Finally, due consideration is given to local antibiotic therapy, with an emphasis on the ototoxicity of chemotherapeutical agents, such as amino-glycosides.

Studies were undertaken on the immune reactions in aging at cerebral atherosclerosis and parkinsonism. With age a number of changes occurred, which were characterized by a decrease in specific and non-specific immunity, against the background of which the autoimmune reactions were developing. There was an increase in the frequency of the detection of antibodies to antigens of the brain as well as in those of the aorta, heart, liver and pancreatic gland. The "peak" of autoimmune reactions was registered at 65 years in men and 75 years in women. There were lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, which together with homologic antigens inhibited the migration of macrophages. In subjects aged 90 years and over the autoantibodies occurred in a lower percent of cases as compared with the subjects aged 60--74. In subjects aged 45--55 with cerebral atherosclerosis the indices under study appeared to be close to those in healthy persons aged 60--74. Still more marked immunological shifts were found in patients with parkinsonism. The findings may suggest a certain role of the autoimmune mechanisms in pathogenesis of some forms of nervous pathology at late stages of ontogenesis and atherosclerosis.

Involving cortical regions, capillaries of the human cerebrum of two 19 and 27 years old men, a 69 years old woman and a 72 years old man were stereologically investigated by optical-electronic image-analysis. The cortical capillary net work was demonstrated by the alkaline phosphatase activity. Each cortex region comprised a determination of the stereological parameters diameter, projected area, specific surface area, capillary distances in linear direction of TV-lines and total length per unit cortex volume. A comparison between different cortex regions revealed a good correlation between increased values of the diameter and the projected area, a decreased specific surface area and diminished capillary distances, which entail a shortened distance of oxygen diffusion through the cortical tissue. During aging a diminished capillary surface area, which results from increased values of diameter and projected area is compensated by shortened capillary distances. Presumably an augmented capillary length is due to a condensation of the capillary net per unit cortex tissue. The behaviour of the registered stereological parameters seems to be an accommodation of the capillary net in the human cerebrum to metabolic and circulatory changes during aging.

The leucocyte migration test (LMT) was performed on 20 patients with an intolerance to glafenin--a non-narcotic analgesic drug. LMT was found to be positive in 50% of the subjects with intolerance, a highly significant percentage as compared with the control groups. HSA-glafenin was found to be the most appropriate method for presenting the antigen, but glafenin and its hydroxylated metabolites were only found to induce a migration inhibition in the subjects intolerant to glafenin.

There has been no description of the hemodynamic dose-response relationship between halothane and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), although these drugs are used together frequently for induction of deliberate hypotension. Utilizing aortic root cannulation and thermister-tipped pulmonary artery catheterization, this relationship was studied in 6 beagles receiving a standard 100 microgram/kg infusion of SNP solution administered at 3 different infusion rates (5, 10, and 20 microgram/kg/min) while anesthetized with 3 different concentrations of halothane (0.5, 1, and 2%). Sodium nitroprusside infusion resulted in dose-related reductions in mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular stroke work. Increasing concentrations of halothane significantly potentiated the hypotensive effects of SNP. Cardiac output increase as the SNP infusion rate increased, whereas increasing the halothane concentration resulted in a reduction of cardiac output at each SNP infusion rate studied. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure was significantly reduced by SNP infusion at all 3 halothane concentrations, whereas mean pulmonary artery pressure was unchanged. Arterial pH fell in response to each SNP infusion, from 7.46 at the beginning of the study to 7.32 at the end (p less than 0.001). Sodium nitroprusside predictably induced hypotension during halothane anesthesia at the cost of a dose-related metabolic acidosis. Increasing the depth of halothane anesthesia afforded a greater percentage reduction in arterial pressure at each SNP infusion rate studied. Metabolic acidosis, however, developed no more rapidly at 2% halothane than it did at 0.5 or 1%.

We describe a new form of mechanical pulmonary ventilation, low-frequency positive pressure ventilation with extracorporeal CO2 removal (LEPPV-ECCO2R). In a series of animal studies the rate of mechanical ventilation was 0.66, 1, 2, and 4 min-1 at a tidal volume of 3, 10, and 15 ml kg-1. We were able to maintain normal blood gases and normal lung volumes and lung mechanics even at the lowest ventilator rate with tidal volumes of 10 or 15 ml kg-1. Each experiment lasted 7 hours. Our data suggest a possible new dimension in the management of a difficult patient on mechanical pulmonary ventilation.

The authors propose a pathogenic classification of perforations of the dura mater occurring during continuous epidural anaesthesia: according to the flow through the communication with the subarochnoid space. Two clinical forms of anaesthesia affecting the cord itself may be distinguished on this basis, one frequent and of immediate onset, diagnosed by the "test dose" and the other rare, of delayed onset, where this safety measure does not suffice. Routine prior epidurography is suggested, in order to ensure the diagnosis of dura mater perforation. In the case of the latter, it show either a more or less typical appearance of radicolography only or, more rarely, a picture which combines opacification of the epidural space with the subarachnoid passage of the contrast medium. This "mixed" appearance, although rare, should be known since it makes it possible to prevent delayed total spinal anaesthesia.

The authors report on their experience with a solution of amino acids concentrated at 25 gomegaN/liter in eighty patients on exclusive and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The average duration of the TPN is 35.08 days. Azonutril 25 was given as nutritive melange, maintaining a calorie-nitrogen ratio of 150 to 200 calories for every added gram of nitrogen. The clinical and biological studies provide a series of arguments in favor of such an amino acid solution in total parental nutrition in patients with acute or chronic digestive insufficiency. No signs of renal or hepatic intolerance have appeared during this study. The improvement in nitrogen balance in fifteen patients is strongly significant (P less than 0.001) and can be correlated with weight gain and with the classic immunological tests.

Ten adult patients with psychiatric disorders in the intensive care ward were examined. The length of stay varied from one week to four months and mechanical ventilation was necessary for all patients. Their experience of intensive care and their psychosensorial problems were as follows: temperospatial disorientation, perturbation of the sense of posture, hallucinations which could go as far as oneiric delirium, anguish and symptoms of depression. No psychotic syndrome, literraly speaking, was observed objectively. In the monthes that followed the stay under intensive care many patients presented important psychosomatic disorders. Organic factors are responsible for these complications, though the environment of the intensive care could induce a marked disafferentation. An effort by the attending staff, aimed at orientating or "reafferenting" these patients, could reduce these problems.

Protein binding of lidocaine (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 microgram/ml in fresh plasma was studied from pH 5.6 to pH 9.8. Percent binding of lidocaine was inversely related to hydrogen-ion and lidocaine concentrations.

On the basis of four cases of oesophago-tracheal fistulae developing in ventilated patients, the authors describe the pathogenesis of these lesions, related to circulatory disturbances in the tracheal mucosa in contact with the balloon of the balloon of the tracheal tube. The spontaneous course is rapidly fatal and the results of surgical treatment remain disappointing. Prevention of these lesions is essential but difficult. It is based above all on the use of "large volume and low pressure" balloons, with periodic exsufflation. The diagnosis of these lesions must be make early and is base upon the development of tracheal dilatation, even minimal and seen radiologically by the appearance of the tube balloon. Such a finding should lead to endoscopic exploration of the tranchea and oesophagus, in order that treatment may be strated rapidly.

The method of choice for the early detection of air metabolism during neurosurgical operations in a sitting position is that of continuous cardiac auscultation using Doppler effect ultrasound apparatus. In the present study, involving 15 patients, an air embolism was produced by the injection of 2 ml of CO2 into the right heart and acoustic changes were recorded on paper using a photographic process. These optical changes, although variable, were invariably present and characteristic of aire emboli and represent an additional element in early diagnosis.

An unusual observation is reported concerning intoxication by an anticholinesterasic. In this case a traumatic blow was caused by an industrial liquid projected under high pressure and resulted in a true parenteral injection. This product, presumed not to be toxic, lead to the delayed appearance of a massive and eventually fatal intoxication. The problemes of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of this type of intoxication are commented on.

The authors report the clinical case of a patients who underwent four anaesthetic inductions during a period of 3 months. Two were associated with severe acute hypertension making the intended operation impossible at that time. Thorough investigations led to a diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma. Reviewing the protocol of the four anaesthetic inductions, the authors discuss the mechanism of provocation of paroxysmal hypertension which was seen on two occasions.

It is possible to use the photoproteins aequorin and obelin within the slowly responding striated muscle films to provide both qualitative and quantitive information as to the nature of the calcium-dependent reactions for force development. It seems that these reactions are not in equilibrium with the Ca2+ during a transient response. In addition, these experiments suggest that kinetically at least two calciums are required per functional unit for force development and that this active site is competed for by Mg2+, H+, and K+ ions.

The theme of this presentation has been to show that the control of transmitter release at the neuromuscular synapse is achieved by extracellular and intracellular calcium. For the fast information transfer represented by the end-plate potential, the electrochemical gradient for calcium across the presynaptic membrane and the associated calcium conductance seem to play the primary role. For slower processes such as tetanic and posttetanic potentiation, the combined effect of both sources for calcium determine the amount of transmitter liberated.

Cutaneous form of periarteritis nodosa. Four personal cases are added to 70 cases of the previous literature. The clinical and biological picture of the cutaneous form of P.A.N. are different from the systemic one by the lack of visceral involvement and a noteworthy good long-term prognosis. Venous (superficial thrombophlebitis) and distal arterial involvement in some cases, raise doubts about diagnosis and classification. The solution is in an accurate definition of the diagnostic clues and specially of the histopathological ones.

Some aspects of the ""Graft-Versus-Host'' (GVH) reaction were studied in White Leghorn chickens by assessing the splenic response of recipients to an injection of lymphocytes from donors. The responses varied according to the origin of recipient embryos as well as to the source of the donor lymphocytes. Blood lymphocytes induced a higher splenomegaly in recipients than spleen lymphocytes, at least in the first seven weeks of life. The influence of the thymus on GVH reactions was also investigated. Lymphocytes from thymectomized chickens induced stronger responses than lymphocytes from non-thymectomized ones. These results support the conclusion that in the chicken T-lymphocytes may not be the only cells involved in the development of GVH reactions and cast some doubts on the reliability of GVH reactions to check the T specificity of immunological cellular responses.

Three beta1-selective beta-blocker (metoprolol, practolol and H 87/07) were compared in 29 patients with stable angina pectoris. The main pharmacological difference between the three beta-blockers was their intrinsic stimulating activity (I.S.A.), metoprolol being devoid of I.S.A., practolol having moderate I.S.A. and H 87/07 having high I.S.A. Each drug was given in randomized order and the length of each cross-over period was 2 weeks. Daily activity was measured by an automatic step-counter, and subjective symptoms and nitroglycerin consumption were registered on a diary-card. Objective data, such as ECG changes and exercise capacity, were obtained by bicycle ergometer tests performed at the end of each period. At rest, the heart rate was significantly lower on metoprolol than on practolol or H 87/07. During exercise, the heart rate was significantly higher on H 87/07 than on practolol or metoprolol. No other haemodynamic differences were found between the three beta-blockers. No differences were found between the three test periods with regard to daily activity, expressed as the number of steps walked, while on the beta-blocker with high I.S.A., H 87/07, the attack rate and nitroglycerin consumption were significantly higher than when the patients were on metoprolol and practolol. No difference was found between the three beta-blockers with regard to total work or exercise time until 1 mm of S-T segment depression. Except for one patient who experienced a severe exanthema on practolol, the three beta-blockers were equally well tolerated.

The problem of microbial cell immobilization at present attracts the ever increasing attention of the scientists, since such organisms may be the source of various enzymes. Production of nizin by the immobilized cells of Str. lactis was studied. It was found that the cells of Str. lactis incorporated into polyacrylamide gel produced nizit on definite media. Still, the amount of the antibiotic was 2-3 times lower than in case of using free cells. The effect of a number of factors on the process of immobilization was studied and the influence of some factors, such as temperature, pH, aeration on nizin synthesis by the immobilized cells of the streptococcus was elucidated. Optimal conditions for nizin biosynthesis by the immobilized cells of Str. lactis were developed.

The efficiency of poliovirus elution from fiber glass cartridge filters (K27), epoxy-fiber glass-asbestos filters (M780), and pleated cartridge filters was assessed by using 3% beef extract (pH 9.0) or 0.1 M glycine (pH 11.5). Poliovirus type I, strain LSc, was seeded into 20- to 25-gallon (ca. 75.6- to 95.6-liter) samples of treated sewage effluent and concentrated by using a filter adsorption-elution technique. Virus elution was accomplished by using either two 600-ml portions of 3% beef extract (pH 9.0), or two 1-liter portions of 0.1 M glycine (pH 11.5). In all experiments, beef extract elution followed by organic flocculation was found to be superior, yielding a mean recovery efficiency of 85%, with recoveries ranging from 68 to 100%. Elution with 0.1 M glycine (pH 11.5) followed by inorganic flocculation resulted in a mean recovery efficiency of 36%. The variable range of recoveries with beef extract could not be significantly improved by varying the type of beef extract or by extending the elution time to 30 min. Second-step reconcentration of 1-liter seeded sewage effluent and renovated wastewater samples indicated that organic flocculation was a more efficient method for virus recovery than inorganic flocculation. Beef extract concentrations of less than 3% were found to be efficient in the recovery of poliovirus from renovated wastewater.

The dose of 0.5 mg/kg i.v. of compound 48/80 was lethal in 97.2% of the injected rats. Observations before death and at autopsy were in accordance with the basic effect of compound 48/80 in rats i.e. the sustained release of mast cell mediators, whose action on the cardiovascular system leads to circulatory collapse. The administration of drugs with various pharmacological effects before the intravenous challenge with compound 48/80 allowed us to conclude that the following effects are not sufficient to prevent the lethal shock: inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis; H2-histamine antagonism; cholinergic, alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockade; beta-adrenergic stimulation; CNS-effects of antidepressants, hypnotics, sedatives, neuroleptics or narcotic analgesics; ganglion blockade; glucocorticoid or cromoglycate-like activity. Dose-dependent protection from the lethal reaction was obtained with compounds known to exert a single or several actions of the following types: oxatomide-like inhibition of mast cell mediator release; h1-histamine antagonism; serotonin antagonism. Quantitatively, however, when measured in in vitro systems these effects are poorly related to the protection from lethal compound 48/80 challenge. The new test offers the advantage of a simple, comprehensive measure of the potency of a compound to prevent mast cell-mediated shock.

The anticholinesterase (antiChE) activity of haloperidol, droperidol and trifluperidol was studied by employing dog plasma as a cholinesterase source and changes in arterial blood pressure, elecited by a mixture of acetylcholine (Ach) and dog plasma with or without those drugs, as an indicator of their antiChE activity. When butyrophenones were present in concentrations of 0.5 up to 5 X 10(-4)M in plasma containing Ach the hypotensive effect of the latter was preserved. Such findings provide experimental evidence that butyrophenones may exert antiChE activity.

Central depressant actions of a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, indenolol (YB-2), and its dextro isomer were studied in mice and rabbits. d-Indenolol was less active than dl-indenolol in lowering of methamphetamine group toxicity and calming of fighting behavior, though muscle relaxant, hypolocomotive and anticonvulsant effects of d-indenolol were virtually equal to those of the racemate. dl-Propranolol showed a similar profile of central depressant actions to dl-indenolol, whereas dl-practolol revealed no significant central effects in mice. The dose-response relationship between beta-blocking and central effects in the same animal species suggested that both taming and anti-methamphetamine group toxicity effects of dl-indenolol s.c. do not directly relate to either the peripheral beta-blocking or the membrane stabilizing activity. Intravenous as well as intracerebroventricular administration of dl-indenolol resulted in suppression of pressor responses to the electrical stimulation of the brain stem of unanesthetized rabbits. Neither d-indenolol nor dl-practolol was effective against the pressor responses, suggesting that these two compounds acted on the CNS in a manner different from dl-indenolol even when intracerebroventricularly administered. A possible central beta-adrenergic blocking effect of dl-indenolol was discussed in the light of mechanisms of an antihypertensive action of this compound.

The glucagon-releasing activity of adenosine-5'-ethyl-carboxamide (744-96) was studied in conscious dogs pretreated either with aminophylline or with bupranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug. The adenosine antagonist, aminophylline, inhibited both the glucagon-releasing and the blood pressure lowering effects of 744-96 (10 microgram/kg i.v.). The actions of the adenosine analogue on glucagon release and haemodynamics were not affected by bupranolol pretreatment. These results indicate that the adenosine analogue mediates glucagon release by interaction with so-called adenosine receptors. A beta-adrenoceptor mediated release secondary to 744-96-induced hypotension and baroreceptor-activation can be excluded.

Measurement of the blood volume in cases of essential hypertension has shown a negative correlation with increase in blood pressure. We have been able to distinguish a group of moderate hypertensives who are hypervolemic, and whose systemic effect is more marked than in the moderate hypovolemic type. Such cases respond poorly to single drug therapy with beta blockers, but well to diuretics. The authors propose a general treatment scheme for essential hypertension: single therapy (beta blockers or diuretics) in mild cases of hypertension; single therapy by diuretics in the moderate types with the increased volume; single therapy by beta blockers in the moderate types with low volume, multiple treatment with the drugs together in cases of severe hypertension.

This article reviews the evidence that neuroleptics may increase the risk of breast cancer via their effects on prolactin secretion. All available neuroleptics, including reserpine, raise serum prolactin levels. Elevated serum prolactin level increases the incidence of spontaneously occurring mammary tumors in mice, and increases the growth of established carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in rats. Caution is necessary in extrapolating this relationship to human mammary tumors because human and rodent tumors differ in some important characteristics, including hormone responsiveness. Serum prolactin levels in women with, or at risk for, breast cancer have generally been normal, and only a minority of human mammary tumors respond to changes in serum prolactin levels. Epidemiologic studies have failed to demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer associated with the use of neuroleptics or reserpine. Thus, although some human mammary tumors are prolactin dependent, the available evidence does not demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer in women receiving neuroleptics. We conclude that (1) additional epidemiologic studies of the incidence of mammary tumors in women treated with neuroleptics are desirable; (2) it is premature to mandate warning patients of an unknown and undemonstrated increase in the risk of developing breast cancer associated with neuroleptic treatment; (3) detection of existing mammary tumors by breast examination prior to administration of neuroleptics is desirable; and (4) development of antipsychotic drugs that do not increase serum prolactin level may be indicated.

The interactions of 3 classical alpha-adrenergic antihypertensives of prevalently central type (St 155 or clonidine St 600; BR 750 or guanabenz) with the narcotic effects of pentobarbital have been investigated in the Mus musculus. Interferences between convulsant drugs and spontaneous and coordinatory motor activity were also analysed in comparative studies.

This retrospective study describes the response of 13 delusional unipolar depressives to combination antipsychotic-tricyclic antidepressant drug therapy. The Research Diagnostic Criteria were used by two independent raters to verify the presence of a delusional, primary, unipolar, major depressive disorder. Thirteen patients met the criteria and received combined antipsychotic-antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Twelve of the 13 responded. This contrasts sharply with the low response rate described for delusional depressives when treated with tricyclic antidepressants alone. Descriptive characteristics of the delusional depressives were compared with those of a group of nondelusional unipolar depressives. Delusional depressives had histories of a greater number of prior depressive episodes and more of the delusional depressives demonstrated a psychomotor disturbance.

Some investigators have found benzodiazepines effective in the treatment of anxious depression and thus have argued that benzodiazepines were "antidepressants." We reviewed the literature on benzodiazepines in depressive disorders. Comparative studies indicate they are less effective than standard antidepressants in the treatment of several types of depressive illnesses. Although they display definite anxiolytic properties and may elevate mood, they exert limited effect on the core symptoms of endogenous depression. An argument is made that benzodiazepines are primarily anxiolytic rather than antidepressant.

This review surveys the therapeutic efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors in schizophrenic patients. In general, the use of these drugs alone was found not to be warranted in schizophrenia, except perhaps in the so-called pseudoneurotic subgroup. In most cases, combinations of antidepressants and phenothiazines were not more beneficial than phenothiazines alone. In particular, the conditions of agitated patients and patients with histories of social deviance dating back to childhood were often made worse by the addition of an antidepressant. However, when the patients who demonstrated symptoms of clinical depression other than anergia were isolated from several of these studies, it was found that they constituted a subgroup that was often benefited by use of these combinations. Favorable and unfavorable clinical response patterns are discussed, and recommendations for future research are outlined.

Intravenously administered methylphenidate, 0.5 mg/kg, causes a consistent rise in human serum growth hormone level, with peak values usually occurring 30 minutes after infusion. This rise is attenuated in patients receiving various antipsychotic medications administered on a long-term basis and is decreased in schizophrenic and drug-dependent patients. Methylphenidate causes increases in talkativeness, blood pressure, and pulse that generally parallel increases in serum growth hormone level. However, in contrast to the methylphenidate-induced rise in serum growth hormone level, methylphenidate-induced changes in cardiovascular variables and talkativeness are not altered by antipsychotic medications or diagnostic classification.

An increase in the level of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) may be caused by a wide variety of pathologic lesions that involve multiple organs, since the enzyme is an ubiquitous one. Before one attempts to identify a significant pathologic abnormality, the clinician should consider the possibility of a physiologic or spurious cause for an increased level of ALP. A decreased ALP level also has diagnostic value.

Syrian hamster interferon, produced by benzo(a)pyrene-transformed embryo cells does not display an affinity for Zn++ chelate-agarose. However, the interferon binds to Cu++ chelate-agarose and can be displaced from the column by a falling pH-gradient. The chromatography of crude hamster interferon preparation on a tandem of columsn: Zn++ chelate-agarose in equilibrium Cu++ chelate-agarose results in a 25-fold purification of interferon.

Details of the design and construction of removable and simple fixed appliances are presented. Equipment, instruments, and supplies are listed. Welding, soldering, banding and bonding are illustrated. Finally, step-by-step descriptions are given of first aid measures for the repair of fixed appliances applicable to the general practice situation.

Deaths from coronary heart disease and myocardial infarct may occur in previously undiagnosed subjects (the so called pre-hospital phase), in hospital following admission to a coronary care unit, or following discharge. Mortality in the pre-hospital phase has been estimated at 35--40 per cent. Within Australia the mortality in the coronary care unit is 11--17 per cent. Following discharge, the mortality is about 20 per cent in the first 12 months and then occurs at about four to five per cent per year for the first five years.

The opinion is emerging that beta-blocking drugs have an important role in management of patients following acute myocardial infarction. Already beta-blocking drugs are accepted as the treatment of choice in hypertension and in angina pectoris--in the major risk factor and consequence respectively of coronary atherosclerosis, and both commonly recognized in patients who survive acute myocardial infarction. But beta-blocking drugs also may be of benefit in reducing the incidence and risk of subsequent infarction, and so may be of value for long term treatment of patients who have no symptoms whatever following acute infarction.

The mechanisms whereby myocardial infarction in man is precipitated are not understood--largely because the event is usually well established by the time medical help is called, but also because the techniques available have not yet permitted analysis of the earliest changes. On the other hand, the consequences of myocardial infarction for the heart and circulation are now well understood, and the need for therapy better appreciated.

Acute myocardial infarction is associated with pain, tissue damage and circulatory impairment. As a result of these changes, there is increased sympathetic drive to the heart in the form of increased sympathetic nerve activity and increased circulating catecholamines.

For many years the search has gone on for suitable drug therapy to improve survival following myocardial infarction. Most recently, beta-adrenergic blockade has entered the lists. Naturally beta-blockade is used in the conventional way to combat angina pectoris following an infarct, and one can expect that 70 per cent of patients will obtain significant relief.

The place of beta-blockade following myocardial infarction should be considered in two phases; the acute infarction, and the long term management after infarction.

Six orbiviruses, Corriparta, Wallal, Eubenangee, D'Aguilar, Warrego and Mitchell River, were inactivated within 30 min in solutions of pH less than 6. All but Wallal virus resisted treatment with ether at 1 degrees for 22 h but only Corriparta virus resisted treatment with chloroform at 1 degrees for 22 h. The genomes of the orbiviruses, including Corriparta virus, after electrophoresis in acrylamide gels separated into basically similar patterns which were distinct from the pattern of reovirus RNA.

Data from steady-state kinetic analysis of yeast K+-activated aldehyde dehydrogenase are consistent with a ternary complex mechanism. Evidence from alternative substrate analysis and product-inhibition studies supports an ordered sequence of substrate binding in which NAD+ is the leading substrate. A preincubation requirement for NAD+ for maximum activity is also consistent with the importance of a binary enzyme-NAD+ complex. Dissociation constant for enzyme-NAD+ complex determined kinetically is in reasonable agreement with that determined by direct binding. The order of substrate addition proposed here differs from that proposed for a yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase previously reported. Different methods of purification produced an enzyme that showed similar kinetic characteristics to those reported here.

The midpoint potentials, Em, for the oxidation of the characteristic e.p.r. signal with g values near 4.3, 3.7 and 2.01, of the nitrogenase Mo-Fe proteins from a number of bacteria were measured. They were 0mV for Clostridium pasteurianum, -42mV for Azotobacter chroococcum and Azotobacter vinelandii, -95mV for Bacillus polymyxa and -180mV for Klebsiella pneumoniae Mo-Fe proteins at pH 7.9. The oxidations were thermodynamically reversible for the proteins from A. chroococcum, A. vinelandii and K. pneumoniae and the Em was independent of protein activity for this last protein. The protein from C. pasteurianum required a lower potential for reduction than for oxidation, and the oxidation of the protein from B. polymyxa was only 70% reversible. The apparent Em of the latter protein was decreased by 40mV in the presence of 60mM-MgCl2. The pH-dependence of the Em of the protein from K. pneumoniae was interpreted in terms of a single ionization, not directly associated with the e.p.r.-active centre, with a pKa of 7.0 in the oxidized form of the protein and a pH-independent region at low pH (Em = 118 +/- 6.3 mV). Approx. 20% increase in activity after oxidation was observed for the proteins from B. polymyxa, A. chroococcum and K. pneumoniae. The significance of the above results and their relationship to other published data are discussed.

The formation of isodesmosine and desmosine in vitro by the action of lysyl oxidase on tropoelastin was studied. The synthesis of desmosines occurred in the absence of additional substances. The formation of desmosines was not affected by removal of molecular O2 from the reaction medium nor was it affected by the lack of proline hydroxylation in tropoelastin. However, there was virtually no desmosine formation at 15 degrees C, a temperature not conducive to coacervation, indicating that coacervation is an important prerequisite for cross-linking.

Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (EC 4.1.3.5) was purified from ox liver, and obtained essentially free from 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolases. The kinetic behaviour, like that of the synthases from chicken liver and yeast, is compatible with a reaction pathway involving condensation of an acetyl-enzyme with acetoacetyl-CoA. The Km for acetoacetyl-CoA, less than 1 micronM at pH 7.8, may possibly be low enough to permit rapid ketogenesis under physiological conditions without the need for a binary complex between the synthase and oxoacyl-CoA thiolase.

A neutral proteinase secreted by rabbit synovial fibroblasts in parallel with specific collagenase was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography. At pH 7.6 this proteinase degraded 35S-labelled bovine nasal proteoglycan and azo-casein. The enzymic activity was inhibited by EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline and serum, whereas di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate and soya-bean trypsin inhibitor had little effect. By gel filtration the apparent mol.wt. of the enzyme was 25000. The fibroblast neutral proteinase was compared with the proteoglycan-degrading neutral proteinases of rabbit polymorphonuclear-leucocyte granules. Two distinct activities were found in the granules: one was inhibited by soya-bean trypsin inhibitor and the other by EDTA. The proteoglycan-degrading proteinases of rabbit fibroblasts and polymorphonuclear leucocytes at acid pH also were examined. Both cathepsin D and a thiol-dependent proteinase contributed to the degradation of proteoglycan at pH 4.5.

1. The formation of the non-enzymic adduct of NAD(+) and sulphite was investigated. In agreement with others we conclude that the dianion of sulphite adds to NAD(+). 2. The formation of ternary complexes of either lactate dehydrogenase or malate dehydrogenase with NAD(+) and sulphite was investigated. The u.v. spectrum of the NAD-sulphite adduct was the same whether free or enzyme-bound at either pH6 or pH8. This suggests that the free and enzyme-bound adducts have a similar electronic structure. 3. The effect of pH on the concentration of NAD-sulphite bound to both enzymes was measured in a new titration apparatus. Unlike the non-enzymic adduct (where the stability change with pH simply reflects HSO(3) (-)=SO(3) (2-)+H(+)), the enzyme-bound adduct showed a bell-shaped pH-stability curve, which indicated that an enzyme side chain of pK=6.2 must be protonated for the complex to form. Since the adduct does not bind to the enzyme when histidine-195 of lactate dehydrogenase is ethoxycarbonylated we conclude that the protein group involved is histidine-195. 4. The pH-dependence of the formation of a ternary complex of lactate dehydrogenase, NAD(+) and oxalate suggested that an enzyme group is protonated when this complex forms. 5. The rate at which NAD(+) binds to lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase was measured by trapping the enzyme-bound NAD(+) by rapid reaction with sulphite. The rate of NAD(+) dissociation from the enzymes was calculated from the bimolecular association kinetic constant and from the equilibrium binding constant and was in both cases much faster than the forward V(max.). No kinetic evidence was found that suggested that there were interactions between protein subunits on binding NAD(+).

A photochemical method for producing proton nuclear polarization in phenolic biogenic molecules such as tyrosyl polypeptides and phenolic amines is described. The nuclear polarization is due to the reversible hydrogen-atom transfer from the phenolic hydroxy group to triplet photoexcited xanthene-dye molecules. Typical results obtained with insulin, catecholamines and other phenolic molecules are treated in detail.

1. pH-dependence of glycolysis has generally been ascribed to the effects of pH on the activities of glycolytic enzymes. The present study shows that sugar transport is pH-dependent in cultured Ehrlich ascites-tumour cells. 2. The rates of glucose consumption, of 3-O-methylglucose transport, and of 2-deoxyglucose transport and phosphorylation increased as linear functions of pH, as the pH of the cell culture medium was increased from 6.1 to 8.5. Transport of glucose, as measured in ATP-depleted cells, was pH-dependent to the same extent as transport of the non-metabolizable sugars. 3. Glucose consumption rates were about 8-fold higher at pH 8.5 than at pH 6.4. About 65-85% of glucose was converted into lactate. Sugar transport rates were 2.5-fold higher at pH 8.5 than at pH 6.3. 4. pH affected both simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. pH effect was mainly on the Vmax. of 2-deoxyglucose uptake, and on the rapid-uptake phase of 3-O-methylglucose transport. 5. It was estimated that about 70% of the pH effect on the rates of glucose consumption may be due to the effect on sugar transport and the remainder to the effect on the activities of glycolytic enzymes.

Cholesterol ester hydrolase activity was determined in preparations of rabbit and guinea pig aorta utilizing micellar and glycerol-dispersed cholesterol oleate substrates. Both substrate preparations demonstrated an acid pH optimum of 4--5 for the soluble and particulate rabbit media cholesterol ester hydrolase, suggesting a lysosomal origin for this activity. Approximately one-fifth of the total recovered activity was particulate. Particulate media preparations from guinea pig aorta also demonstrated cholesterol ester hydrolase activity at acid pH values with a definite optimum at pH 5 for the glycerol-dispersed substrate. However, in contrast to the rabbit media enzyme, activity was also observed at neutral pH with another optimum at pH 7. The supernatant enzyme from guinea pig media exhibited only a single pH optimum of 7. Cholesterol ester hydrolase activity from either rabbit or guinea pig media was not influenced by preincubation with cyclic AMP, ATP and protein kinase. The addition of chloroquine resulted in the inhibition of both the rabbit and guinea pig enzyme. Cholesterol ester hydrolase activity from rabbit and guinea pig media was also inhibited by phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride; activity measured at pH 7 (guinea pig) was more sensitive to inhibition than activity measured at pH 5 (guinea pig and rabbit).

Performance of the IL 613 automatic blood-gas analyser has been assessed using a group of 100 "analysts" with no previous training or experience in the use of the instrument. Test material consisted of blood equilibrated to a known PO2 and PCO2 in a tonometer: pH estimations were carried out on thawed aliquots of a large batch of frozen serum which were then equilibrated to a known PCO2. Eighty-six per cent of analyses were within acceptable limits of error. The largest proportion of errors was in the measurement of pH. Satisfactory results were obtained in 98% of the analyses of PO2 and PCO2. Eighty-eight per cent of operators were able to use the analyser after instruction lasting less than 1 min. These results were significantly better than those obtained in a regional survey of 16 blood-gas laboratories, staffed by trained technicians.

Lorazepam 2.5 mg was compared with promethazine 50 mg as oral premedication in a double-blind study in women. The premedication was given at the same time to all patients on each operating list, and both drugs continued to be effective 6 h after ingestion. A similar number of patients considered each drug to have relieved anxiety and the amnesic effect of lorazepam was confirmed. However, the use of lorazepam alone was accompanied by significantly more salivation during and after anaesthesia than the use of promethazine, especially in patients in whom the trachea was intubated. There was also a higher frequency of vomiting during and after operation with lorazepam (seven of 67 patients) than after promethazine (one of 71 patients). Promethazine produced dyskinetic side-effects in six of 71 patients.

The effectiveness of naloxone and doxapram in reversing the respiratory depressant actions of fentanyl and droperidol in the rabbit has been examined. Both drugs did not reverse fully the depression of respiratory frequency produced by the neuroleptanalgesic agents. Doxapram also failed to reverse fully the depression of minute volume produced by fentanyl and droperidol, although naloxone was adequate in this respect. However, analysis of arterialized venous blood showed that both naloxone and doxapram not only prevented the increase in PCO2 caused by fentanyl and droperidol, but caused also a significant decrease. A reduction in PCO2 was seen also when either naloxone or doxapram was given to untreated rabbits. With doxapram this appeared to be a result of pure respiratory stimulation. Naloxone also produced a reduction in standard bicarbonate.

We have stored at -196 degrees C peripheral blood buffy coat (BC) and bone marrow (BM) cells collected from 47 patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia in the chronic phase. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) 10% was used as cryoprotective agent. As these cells include CFUc and probably pluripotential stem cells they may be transfused as part of the management of patients who enter blast cell transformation. The mean numbers of nucleated cells collected and stored per procedure was about 9 times greater for BC collections than for BM harvests (106 +/- 49 (SD) X 10(9) versus 11.9 +/- 6.6 X 10(9) respectively). Agar CFUc assay showed that stored cells may remain viable for up to 5 years. Since in vitro studies showed that CFUc proliferation is not inhibited by low concentrations of DMSO the removal of all DMSO during cell reconstitution before transfusion may not be necessary. If autologous BC cells are capable of repopulating the BM of patients treated for CGL in blast cell transformation the routine collection and storage of BC rather than BM cells may be desirable for all newly diagnosed patients.

We made continuous fetal pH-measurement in 50 patients and showed a good correlation between tissue pH and umbilical artery, umbilical vein and the fetal scalp blood pH. There were practical problems in the use of the glass pH electrode.

The mechanism of the acid dimerization of alpha-chymotrypsin in solution was reexamined using a number of chemical derivatives. Blocking of the carboxyl of Tyr-146, while that of ASP-64 remained free, eliminated completely the ability of alpha-chymotrypsin to dimerize, as did methylation of His-57. O-Acetylation of Tyr-146 reduced the dimerization constant to that of gamma-chymotrypsin, and deacetylation of the other accessible tyrosines did not affect the dimerization. It is concluded that the mechanism proposed by Aune and Timasheff [Aune, K.C., and Timasheff, S.N.(1971) Biochemistry 10, 1609-1617] for the solution dimerization which involves the electrostatic interaction between the His-57 imidazolium ring and the terminal carboxyl of Tyr-146 is still most consistent with all the experimental observations. The interactions in dilute solution may differ somewhat from those observed in crystals. In particular, the two intermolecular bridges formed by sulfate ions in crystals cannot be present in solution.

ATP hydrolysis and proton translocation in chromaffin granules were followed using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance. The intragranular pH affects the resonance frequency of the gamma-phosphate of granular ATP. By measuring frequency vs. pH in solutions which simulate the intragranular matrix, this may be calibrated to give quantitative pH measurements. The pH in the resting granule is 5.65 +/- 0.15. This drops by 0.4 to 0.5 pH unit when ATP is added externally and protons are actively pumped into the granules. Because of differences in the composition and pH of the internal and external solutions, the resonances of internal and external nucleotides and Pi can be distinguished. Consequently, ATP hydrolysis and changes in internal pH may be observed simultaneously and continuously in a single sample of chromaffin granules. From the measured buffering capacity of a reconstituted intragranular solution, pH changes were converted into an absolute number of protons translocated. The net proton flux (protons translocated/ATP hydrolyzed) was about 1.0 immediately after external ATP addition but fell toward zero as the pH gradient increased to a new steady state. These 31P NMR results agree with intragranular pH measurements determined from methylamine distribution and with H+/ATP stoichiometries calculated from pH changes observed in the external medium.

ATP concentrations were measured in isolated intact spinach chloroplasts under various light and dark conditions. The following results were obtained: (1) Even in darkened chloroplasts and in the absence of exogenous substrates, ATP levels in the chloroplast stroma were significant. They decreased on addition of glycerate, phosphoglycerate or dihydroxyacetone phosphate. When dihydroxyacetone phosphate and oxaloacetate were added together, ATP levels increased in darkened chloroplasts owing to substrate level phosphorylation. (2) Under illumination with saturating single turnover flashes, oxygen evolution in the presence of phosphoglycerate, whose reduction requires ATP, was no lower on a unit flash basis at the low flash frequency of 2 Hz than at higher frequencies. Quenching of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence, which indicates the formation of a proton gradient in intact chloroplasts, decreased with decreasing flash frequencies, until there was no significant fluorescence quenching at a flash frequency of about 2 Hz. In contrast to intact chloroplasts, broken chloroplasts did not phosphorylate much ADP at the low flash frequency of 2 Hz. (3) Flashing at extremely low frequencies (0.2 Hz) caused ATP hydrolysis rather than ATP synthesis in intact chloroplasts. At higher flash frequencies, synthesis replaced hydrolysis. Still, even at high frequencies (10 Hz), the first flashes of a series of flashes given after a long dark time always decreased chloroplast ATP levels. From these results, it is concluded that the enzyme, which mediates ATP synthesis in the light, is inactive in darkened intact chloroplasts. Its light activation can be separated from the formation of the high energy condition, which results in ATP synthesis. After its activation, the enzyme catalyzes a reversible reaction.

We have previously described a transient high spin ferric heme species in cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) which represent a3+(3) (Beinert, H. and Shaw, R.W.(1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 462, 12u--130), and can be detected and quantitatively determined by EPR. We have now used out ability to generate this species to study reactions of a3+(3) with substrates and ligands and also responses to pH changes. This was accomplished by multiple rapid mixing and freezing techniques in conjunction with low temperature EPR and optical reflectance spectroscopies. The substrates used were O2 and ferrocytochrome c and the ligands cyanide, sulfide, azide and carbon monoxide. Contrary to the oxidized, resting form of the enzyme, the transient high spin species of a3+(3) reacts within less than 10 ms stoichiometrically with cyanide and sulfide and at a slower rate with azide. The transient a3+(3) species responds to O2 and CO by changes in signal size or shape, although no oxidoreduction is involved, indicating that a3+(3) registers the presence of these gases. The high spin signal of the transient species is readily abolished by ferrocytochrome c or on raising the pH. Decreasing the pH induces a shift from the rhombic towards the axial component of the signal. Since the responses to CO and pH are analogous for the rhombic transient species to those observed with the rhombic high spin ferric heme species produced on partial reduction, it is suggested that the rhombic signals represent a3+(3) in either case. In all these experiments, in which EPR detectable a3+(3) was observed in large yield, no extra signals for copper or correspondingly increased intensity in the copper signal at g = 2 were seen. The relationship is discussed of the obviously reactive transient species of a3+(3) to other 'activated' species that have been reported and to the oxidized resting form of the enzyme, which is known to react only slowly with ligands and to respond sluggishly to substrate.

The proton translocating properties of cytochrome c oxidase have been studied in artificial phospholipid vesicles into the membranes of which the isolated and purified enzyme was incorporated. Initiation of oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by addition of the cytochrome, or by addition of oxygen to an anaerobic vesicle suspension, leads to ejection of H+ from the vesicles provided that charge compensation is permitted by the presence of valinomycin and K+. Proton ejection is not observed if the membranes have been specifically rendered permeable to protons. The proton ejection is the result of true translocation of H+ across the membrane as indicated by its dependence on the intravesicular buffering power relative to the number of particles (electrons and protons) transferred by the system, and since it can be shown not to be due to a net formation of acid in the system. Comparison of the initial rates of proton ejection and oxidation of cytochrome c yields a H+/e- quotient close to 1.0 both in cytochrome c and oxygen pulse experiments. An approach towards the same stoichiometry is found by comparison of the extents of proton ejection and electron transfer under appropriate experimental conditions. It is concluded that cytochrome c oxidase is a proton pump, which conserves redox energy by converting it into an electrochemical proton gradient through electrogenic translocation of H+.

1. Particle microelectrophoresis mobility studies have been conducted with chloroplast thylakoid membranes and with isolated intact chloroplasts. 2. The pH dependence of the electrophoretic mobility indicated that at pH values above 4.3 both membrane systems carry a net negative charge. 3. Chemical treatment of thylakoids has shown that neither the sugar residues of the galactolipids in the membrane nor the basic groups of the membrane proteins having pK values between 6 and 10 are exposed at the surface. 4. However, treatment with 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, together with glycine methyl ester, neutralized the negative charges on the thylakoid membrane surface indicating the involvement of carboxyl groups which, because of their pH sensitivity, are likely to be the carboxyl groups of aspartic and glutamic acid residues. 5. The nature of the protein giving rise to the negative surface charges on the thylakoids is not known but is shown not to involve the coupling factor or the light harvesting chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b pigment . protein complex. 6. No significant effect of light was observed on the electrophoretic mobility of either thylakoids or intact chloroplasts. 7. The striking difference in the ability of divalent and monovalent cations to screen the surface charges was demonstrated and explained in terms of the Gouy-Chapman theory. 8. Calculations of the zeta-potentials for thylakoid membranes gave values for the charge density at the plane of shear to be in the region of one electronic charge per 1500--2000 A2. 9. The significance of the results is discussed in terms of cation distribution in chloroplasts and the effect of cations on photosynthetic phenomena.

Calcium ions can trigger an emission of light from Veretillum cynomorium lumisomes (bioluminescent vesicles) under conditions where they are not lysed. This process does not require a metabolically-linked source of energy, but is dependent upon the nature of the ions present inside and outside the vesicles. The Ca2+-triggered bioluminescence is stimulated by an asymmetrical distribution of cations or anions. Either high internal sodium or high external chloride is required for the maximal effect. When sodium is present outside the structure and potassium inside, the slow inward diffusion of calcium is decreased. Unbalanced diffusion of internal cations also stimulates the bioluminescence, suggesting control of the calcium influx by an electrochemical gradient. It is assumed that rapid outward diffusion of sodium or inward diffusion of chloride generates an electrical potential difference (inside negative) which drives the Ca2+-influx. With purified lumisomes it has been shown that Ca2+-triggered bioluminescence and calcium uptake (presumably net uptake) were correlated. In two instances uptake of the lipophilic cation dibenzyldimethylammonium has given direct evidence for the existence of a potential difference. With NaCl-loaded vesicles, it has not been possible to demonstrate an uptake of lipophilic cations but experiments with 22Na and 42D indicated a higher rate of sodium efflux, in accord with the proposed hypothesis.

Spinach chloroplasts have been prepared nonaqueously using non-polar solvents (n-hexane, CCl4, n-hepatane) and the beta-carotene content extracted in a controlled manner. This procedure is reproducible and does not result in large structural or spectral changes of the chloroplasts. The organisation of the chlorophyll-proteins is unaltered, as fragmentation with digitonin results in the appearance of the same fractions as found previously for aqueously-prepared chloroplasts, including the pink zone containing cytochromes f and b6 in the ratio 1 : 2. The chloroplasts possess both Photosystem I activity (P-700 photo-bleaching, and NADP+ photoreduction) and Photosystem II activity (parabenzoquinone reduction with Mn2+ as electron donor, and chlorophyll fluorescence induction). Use of moderate intensity red illumination has allowed a study of the role of beta-carotene in photochemistry separate from its roles in energy transfer and photoprotection. Removal of the fraction of beta-carotene closely associated with the Photosystem I reaction centre caused the rate of NADP+ photoreduction to fall to a low, but significantly non-zero level. Thus, in the complete absence of beta-carotene, photochemistry can still be observed, however the specific association of beta-carotene with the reaction centre is required for maximal rates. We propose that beta-carotene bound at the reaction centre decreases the rate of transfer of excitation energy away from the reaction centre, and increases the rate of photochemistry. It is possible that this occurs via formation of an exciplex between ground state beta-carotene and chlorophyll in the first excited state.

If the extracellular fluid is left unbuffered, dynamic membrane potential changes in the red blood cell may be determined from external pH readings. For some types of experiments it is necessary to accelerate H+ equilibration by adding minute amounts of hydrogen carriers. The method is independent of hematocrit over a wide range of membrane potential changes. Membrane potential jumps produced by permeability changes or by changes in ionic composition may be measured. The method provides a convenient means of measuring parameters of both the conductive and non-conductive anion pathways in the red cell.

The ability of glucose to reverse the effects of dinitrophenol on amino acid uptake in Ehrlich cells is a function of pH. At pH 6.0, the presence of glucose does not reverse the inhibitory action of the uncoupler. Nearly complete restoration occurs with glucose at pH 7.4. At pH 8, the presence of glucose may cause a modest increase in amino acid uptake in presence of dinitrophenol. At all pH values, glucose restores ATP and cellular K+ to the control levels at the same pH. Although the cytoplasmic pH changes with changes in the external pH, the cell interior is more alkaline than the medium near pH 6.0 and more acid than the medium at pH 7.8 even after 45 min incubation at 37 degrees C. With dinitrophenol and in presence of glucose the difference in pH between the medium and the cell is minimal at both pH 6.0 and 7.8.

In the absence of albumin, v/s curves for both condensation and overall chain elongation demonstrated that the specific activity for overall chain elongation was 3.7 times that of condensation. When the molar ratio of palmitoyl-CoA to albumin was greater than 2 : 1, the specific activity of chain elongation exceeded that of condensation. At these low albumin concentrations, in the absence of NADPH, the beta-ketostearoyl-coA was converted back to palmitate. This cleavage reaction is inhibited by albumin in a concentration-dependent manner. When the palmitoyl-CoA to albumin molar ratio was less than 2 : 1, the specific activity for condensation exceeded that for overall chain elongation and some beta-ketostearate was shown to accumulate under chain elongation conditions. The specific activity for dehydration of beta-hydroxystearoyl-CoA was maximal when the acyl-CoA to albumin molar ratio was between 10 : 1 and 4 : 1 but the rate of this reaction was not markedly influenced by variations in albumin concentration. The specific activity for the NADPH-dependent reduction of 2-trans-octa-decenoyl-CoA was 18 nmol . min(-1) . mg(-1) in the absence of albumin and increased to a maximum of 112 when the substrate to albumin molar ratio was 2 : 1. At higher albumin concentrations the reductase reaction was inhibited. Conversely, the specific activity for the reverse dehydrase was maximal at low albumin concentrations and the rate of this reaction declined as the albumin concentration increased. Our results demonstrate that albumin not only alleviates a substrate induced inhibition but also regulates the metabolic fate of 2-trans-octadecenoyl-CoA and in this regard may possibly substitute for acyl-CoA binding proteins.

The primary structure of the two less acidic parvalbumins (pI = 5.44 and pI = 4.95) from coelacanth muscle (Latimeria chalumnae) has been determined. They differ only by the presence or absence of a N-terminal blocking group. By the use of the automatic degradation, 69 amino acids could be placed unambiguously in the N-terminal part and 24 amino acids following the single arginine 75. Tryptic peptides were used to establish the sequence and the position of the remaining residues. The two parvalbumins examined belong to the alpha-lineage, and the rate of their molecular evolution is comparable to that found in other vertebrates.

Cow kappa-casein has been modified by photo-oxidation in the presence of rose bengal and by the chemical reagents diethyl pyrocarbonate, 2-hydroxy-5-nitro-benzyl bromide and iodoacetic acid. Photo-oxidation resulted in the destruction of histidine and tryptophan residues and all of the histidines could be ethoxy-formylated by treatment with diethyl pyrocarbonate. Both procedures caused a loss in the susceptibility of the Phe-Met linkage of kappa-casein to chymosin hydrolysis. Treatment of kappa-casein with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide and iodoacetic acid caused the loss of tryptophan and methionine residues respectively but, in both cases, the susceptibility of the modified protein to chymosin hydrolysis remained unaffected. Of the amino acids examined it is concluded that only the histidine residues of cow kappa-casein are important for the hydrolytic action of chymosin and, furthermore, the treatment with diethyl pyrocarbonate suggests that only one of the three histidines plays an essential role.

The weak binding of lanthanides to the five carboxyl groups of the basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (hereafter termed "the inhibitor"), has been investigated in detail using high resolution 1H NMR at 360 MHz. Lanthanides bind to the C-terminus with an apparent binding constant of 30 M-1, and thus competitively inhibit the formation of a salt-bridge between the C-terminus and the N-terminus, Lanthanides bind also to the side chain carboxyl groups of Asp 3, Glu 7, Glu 49 and Asp 50, with binding constants of 10--30 M-1. With the use of lanthanides individual resonance assignments for Phe 4 and Phe 45 were obtained in the 1H NMR spectrum of the inhibitor, and for several spin systems previous  identifications were independently confirmed. The present experiments also provide a nice illustration for the use of shift reagents to improve the resolution in 1H NMR spectra of proteins. The exchange broadening for Tyr 35 and Phe 45 over the temperature range 4--72 degrees C could thus be observed for almost all the components of these aromatic spin systems and new details on the dynamic properties were obtained also for other aromatic residues.

The effect of acid pH and citrate on the exchange of iron between binding sites of rat transferrin has been studied. In the absence of citrate, diferric transferrin shows stepwise loss of iron atoms with the first atom of iron released at approximately pH 5.2. Citrate at physiologic concentrations (1.10(-3) M) or greater allows random iron removal at pH 6.5 or less. Iron dissociation from monoferric transferrin at acid pH, with or without citrate, is a random process. At pH 7.4, randomization of iron on transferrin takes from 3 to 6 h in the presence of millimolar concentrations of citrate. We conclude that at acid pH and in the presence of citrate concentrations likely to occur in vivo in the rat there is little scrambling of iron bound to transferrin.

In wild-type cells and some riboflavin-deficient mutants of P. guilliermondii GTP is transformed to the ribitylated intermediates 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine and 5-amino-2,6-dihydroxy-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine of the riboflavin biosynthetic path. We were able to show that these compounds were formed in vitro as well as in permeabilized cells by reactions including a reductive conversion of the product of GTP cyclohydrolase II action upon GTP. In order to analyse the pyrimidine derivates, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribitylpterin and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine were synthesized by reaction of pyrimidines with diacetyl. The formation of ribitylated pyrimidines was shown to be strictly dependent on the presence of NADPH2. The data obtained indicate that the reductive step is catalyzed by a 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-ribosylaminopyrimidine-reductase. 6,7-Dimethyl-8-ribitylpterin and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine isolated from the incubation mixtures have been identified by chromatography and by their ultraviolet and fluorescence spectra.

After exposure to serum, an agglutination of mitochondria from yeast, liver, heart and kidney was observed. The degree of agglutination was dependent on the ratio between the amount of serum proteins and mitochondrial protein. The serum protein which induced agglutination was bound irreversibly to the mitochondria, was heat stable and partly resistant to acidification. Maximal agglutination was observed at an ionic strength equal to 40 mM Tris, at pH 6.0-7.5. Preincubation of mitochondria with calcium ions at slightly acidic pH prevented the agglutination. Neuraminidase treatment of either serum or mitochondria had no effect upon the agglutination.

The spectral difference between normal and rapidly reacting deoxyhemoglobin (Sawicki and Gibson (1976), J. Biol Chem. 251:1533-1542) is used to study the relationship between CO binding to hemoglobin and the conformational changes to the rapidly reacting form in a combined flow-laser flash experiment. In both pH 7 phosphate buffer and pH 7 bis(2-hydroxy-ethyl)imino-tris (hydroxymethyl)methane buffer (bis-Tris) with 500 muM 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), the conformational change lags far behind CO binding; rapidly  reacting hemoglobin is not observed until more than 10% of the hemoglobin is liganded. In pH 9 borate buffer the formation of rapidly reacting hemoglobin leads CO binding by a significant amount. A simple two-state allosteric model (Monod et. al. (1965), J. Mol. Biol. 12:88-118) which assumed equivalence of the hemoglobin subunits in their reaction with CO was used to simulate the experimental results. In terms of the model, the conformational change lead observed at pH 9 suggests that significant conformational change has occurred after binding of only one CO molecule per tetramer. In the presence of phosphates good agreement between experimental results and simulations is obtained using parameter values suggested by previous experimental studies. The simulations suggest that the conformational change occurs after binding of three CO molecules.

A pH-sensitive glass electrode was used in a temperature-controlled stopped-flow rapid reaction apparatus to determine rates of pH equilibration in red cell suspensions. The apparatus requires less than 2 ml of reactants. The electrode is insensitive to pressure and flow variations, and has a response time of < 5 ms. A 20% suspension of washed fresh human erythrocytes in saline at pH 7.7 containing NaHCO(3) and extracellular carbonic anhydrase is mixed with an equal volume of 30 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.7. Within a few milliseconds after mixing, extracellular HCO(3) (-) reacts with H(+) to form CO(2), which enters the red cells and rehydrates to form HCO(3) (-), producing an electrochemical potential gradient for HCO(3) (-) from inside to outside the cells. HCO(3) (-) then leaves the cells in exchange for Cl(-), and extracellular pH increases as the HCO(3) (-) flowing out of the cells reacts with H(+). Flux of HCO(3) (-) is calculated from the dpH/dt during HCO(3) (-)-Cl(-) exchange, and a velocity constant is computed from the flux and the calculated intracellular and extracellular [HCO(3) (-)]. The activation energy for the exchange process is 18.6 kcal/mol between 5 degrees C and 17 degrees C (transition temperature), and 11.4 kcal/mol from 17 degrees C to 40 degrees C. The activation energies and transition temperature are not significantly altered in the presence of a potent anion exchange inhibitor (SITS), although the fluxes are markedly decreased. These findings suggest that the rate-limiting step in red cell anion exchange changes at 17 degrees C, either because of an alteration in the nature of the transport site or because of a transition in the physical state of membrane lipids affecting protein-lipid interactions.

The content of nicotinamide dinucleotides in the brain and myocardium induced by electrical stimulation of rats and by injection of toxic noradrenaline doses was investigated. The total level of pyridine nucleotides and of their oxidized forms proved to be decreased, and the content of triphosphopyridine nucleotides and their synthesis activity rose. The data obtained point to disturbances of the redox processes and to increase of hexose monophosphate shunt activity in the tissues by neurogenic dystrophies induced by excessive irritation.

1 The effect of various beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced hyperactivity response produced in rats by administration of tranylcypromine (10 mg/kg i.p.) followed by L-tryptophan (50 mg/kg i.p.) has been investigated. 2 (+/-)-Alprenolol, (+/-)-timolol, (+/-)-sotalol, (+/-)-pindolol (all at 40 mg/kg) all inhibited the hyperactivity response to some degree when given 45 min before the tranylcypromine, as did (+/-)-oxprenolol when given after the L-tryptophan. 3 beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists that are not found in the brain appreciable amount after peripheral injection, (+/-)-atenolol, (+/-)-practolol, (+/-)-labetalol and (+/-)-acebutalol, did not inhibit the 5-HT-mediated behaviour. 4 Neither the beta1-selective drug (+/-)-metoprolol, nor the beta2-selective drug (+/-)-butoxamine inhibited the behavioral response. 5 The drugs that blocked the 5-HT-mediated behaviour did not alter brain 5-HT concentrations, synthesis rate or the accumulation of 5-HT following tranylcypromine/L-tryptophan. However, they did inhibit the hyperactivity produced by the suggested 5-HT agonist, 5-methoxy N,N-dimethyltryptamine, indicating that the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were inhibiting the post-synaptic 5-HT-mediated response. 6 Circling produced by methamphetamine (3 mg/kg) in unilateral nigro-striatal lesioned rats was not altered by alprenolol, sotalol, pindolol or metaprolol, indicating that these drugs do not alter dopamine-mediated behaviour. 7 It is concluded that non-selective (beta1 and beta2) adrenoceptor antagonists which have a high brain/blood ratio following their peripheral injection, block 5-HT-mediated behavioural responses in the rat.

1 Histamine has a dual action on the in situ gall bladder of the guinea-pig: a spasmogenic and a relaxant effect mediated through H1- and H2-receptor stimulation respectively. 2 The contracturant action, mimicked by 2-(2-aminoethyl) thiazole (a specific H1-receptor agonist), is blocked by mepyramine and the relaxation, mimicked by dimaprit (a specific H2-receptor agonist), is inhibited by cimetidine.

1 Rabbit kidneys were isolated and perfused with Tyrode solution. Release of 3H-purines was studied after labeling of the adenine-nucleotide stores with [3H]adenine (more than 60% uptake during a single passage). 2 One hour after labelling the spontaneous 3H-outflow amounted to 0.1 to 0.2% of the total tissue content per minute. The release rate was enhanced following nerve stimulation (3 to 10 Hz), or brief infusion of noradrenaline (0.1 to 2.4 microgram i.a.). Release of radioactivity was also enhanced by angiotensin II, by interruption of perfusion flow for 0.5 to 2 min and by hypoxia (5 to 25% O2). 3 The release of tracer induced by nerve stimulation or noradrenaline was markedly reduced or abolished by phenoxybenzamine, which also inhibited the vasoconstrictor response. The release following angiotensin II, ischaemia and hypoxia could not be antagonized by this alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. 4 the radioactivity in the kidney was predominantly in nucleotide form, while that released was composed mainly of nucleosides, of which adenosine predominated. 5 The results indicate that in the rabbit kidney vasocontriction, arterial clamping or reduced perfusion oxygen tension, cause release of adenosine and related compounds. In view of the reported actions of adenosine on noradrenaline effects and release in the kidney a possible physiological role is discussed.

The alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent, tolazoline, and the O-methylated metabolite of adrenaline, metanephrine, produced a concentration-dependent increase of tension in the smooth muscle of the cat isolated nictitating membrane. These effects were considered to be due to the activation of postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. 2 The responses to nerve stimulation of this muscle were neither potentiated nor blocked by tolazoline (0.1 to 10 micrometer) or metanephrine (1 to 10 micrometer). 3 3H-transmitter overflow evoked by electrical stimulation was not modified by tolazoline or metanephrine in concentrations in which these drugs stimulated the postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. 4 Since tolazoline and metanephrine failed to activate the presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors of the cat nictitating membrane under experimental conditions in which they stimulated the postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors, these results further support the view that the presynaptic (alpha2) adrenoceptors differ from the postsynaptic (alpha1) adrenoceptors.

1 The presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors located on the terminals of the cholinergic nerves of the guineapig myenteric plexus have been characterized according to their sensitivities to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists.2 Electrical stimulation of the cholinergic nerves supplying the longitudinal muscle of the guinea-pig ileum caused a twitch response. Clonidine caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the twitch response; the maximum inhibition obtained was 80 to 95% of the twitch response. Oxymetazoline and xylazine were qualitatively similar to clonidine but were about 5 times less potent. Phenylephrine and methoxamine also inhibited the twitch response but were at least 10,000 times less potent than clonidine.3 The twitch-inhibitory effects of clonidine, oxymetazoline and xylazine, but not those of phenylephrine or methoxamine, were reversed by piperoxan (0.3 to 1.0 mug/ml).4 Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) inhibited the twitch response, but also increased the basal tone of the ileum. Mepyramine prevented the increase in tone but did not affect the inhibitory action of LSD. Piperoxan or phentolamine only partially antagonized the inhibitory effect of LSD.5 Phentolamine, yohimbine, piperoxan and tolazoline were potent, competitive antagonists of the inhibitory effect of clonidine with pA(2) values of 8.51, 7.78, 7.64 and 6.57 respectively.6 Thymoxamine was a weak antagonist of clonidine; it also antagonized the twitch-inhibitory effect of morphine. Thus, its effect against clonidine is probably not mediated specifically at presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors.7 Labetalol, itself, depressed the twitch response but did not antagonize the inhibitory effect of clonidine on the residual twitch.8 The results demonstrate that the presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors in the guinea-pig ileum are of the same type as those located presynaptically in sympathetically innervated tissues. They are alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and are different from those located postsynaptically.

Epidemic haemorrhagic fever is a viral disease characterized by acute febrile onset followed by profound renal dysfunction. The endemic areas are widespread throughout the Eurasian continent and the Japanese islands. The patient with EHF usually seeks medical care as an emergency for an "acute abdomen". Consequently the X-ray examination becomes an essential part of the clinical study. We analysed the plain abdomen and chest films of 62 patients with this disease. The radiologic manifestations represented diffuse capillary damage with resultant oedema and haemorrhage, particularly in the retro-peritoneal space. Abnormal findings were seen in 94% of the patients on the plain abdomen, and in 63% on the chest film. The most significant finding was obliteration and blurring of anatomical detail in both intra- and retro-peritoneal cavities and renal enlargement. We believe that simultaneous presence of oedema and effusion in both intra- and retro-peritoneal cavities along with renal enlargement is in practice pathognomic of EHF. Obliteration of the renal outline and cardiomegaly with overt lung oedema was associated with the most severe renal dysfunction.

Evidence from studies involving release, postsynaptic responses, inactivation, storage and synthesis etc. support the contention that glutamate may be the transmitter of the perforant input to the granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In the present report the release of endogenous glutamate and the levels of reduced pyridine nucleotides (NAD(P)H) has been measured in parallel experiments on slices from the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. A Ca-dependent release of glutamate is evoked by tissue depolarization caused either with electrical field stimulation or with elevated KC1. Electrical stimulation induced a transient increase in tissue NAD(P)H levels, the increase being inhibited by approximately 50% during Ca-free conditions. KC1 stimulation, on the other hand, produced a long-lasting decrease in NAD(P)H, the decrease being halved in the absense of Ca. A metabolic relation between stimulus secretion and energy utilization is discussed.

A thermodynamic analysis has been made of the secondary transition stage in the spontaneous precipitation of calcium phosphate following the amorphous-crystalline transformation. The first formed crystalline material has a solubility similar to that of octacalcium phosphate (OCP) and the computed thermodynamic solubility product remains invariant in the pH range 7.00--8.60. The duration of the secondary stage is sensitive to pH and the transition appears to occur by hydrolysis of the first formed OCP-like phase to a more basic apatitic phase with a tricalcium phosphate (TCP) stoichiometry. The crystalline material at the end of this transition has an invariant solubility product, in the pH range 7.00 to 8.60, when the TCP-like molecular formula is assumed. Changes in the solution chemistry which accompany the solid-to-solid transitions are consistent with the above conclusions. The results of this study are also consistent with those of a previous study which suggest that the stability of the amorphous calcium phosphate phase is dependent upon the instability of the solution phase with respect to OCP formation.

The effect of bilateral renal denervation on water intake and urine volume during specific thirst challenges was studied in rats. Renal denervation attenuated significantly the drinking response elicited by the administration of 30% polyethylene glycol (PG, extracellular challenge) but had no effect on the drinking response after an intracellular challenge (2.5 M NaCl) or after a 24-h water deprivation period. Furthermore, during a PG challenge total water intake was the same in two groups of rats, one with denervated kidneys and the other with beta-adrenergic neural activity in efferent renal nerves eliminated by blocking agents. Urine volumes were not affected by PG administration or water deprivation in denervated rats but were increased significantly after administration of 2.5 M NaCl. These results indicate that renal nerves play an important role in the physiological processes controlling extracellular thirst, and suggest that this role may be related to the neural control of release of renin.

Horses suffer from a respiratory condition, similar to human allergic asthma, that is characterized by severe dyspnea, wheezing, coughing, and mucus production. Mediator substances released during the allergic reaction may contract airways and pulmonary vasculature. Nothing is known of the effects of autacoids and other vasoactive substances on equine pulmonary vessels. Therefore, spiral strips of equine pulmonary vein were prepared in vitro and the effects of histamine (H), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), bradykinin (BK), carbachol (Carb), and phenylephrine (phen) were studied. The order of contractile effectiveness for the agonists on the vein was found to be 5HT greater than H greater than Bk greater than Phen greater than Carb, although H consistently produced the greatest maximal effects. H1-receptors appeared to mediate H contractions while H2-receptors had no measurable effect. 5HT responses were mediated directly by 'D-type' smooth muscle receptors. Bk produced contractions but of a lesser magnitude than either H or 5HT. Varying degrees of tachyphylaxis were observed for each agent. alpha-Adrenergic receptor stimulation by Phen initiated low-magnitude contractions whereas Carb exhibited virtually no activity on the pulmonary vein. Contractile responses of pulmonary veins to various spasmogens may contribute to the equine asthmatic response by raising vascular hydrostatic pressure, thereby enhancing edema formation.

Following intravenous administration of the cholinesterase reactivator HS-6 (30 mg/kg), blood pressure fell (up to 50 mmHg) and maximal blood levels of HS-6 reached 242 microgram/ml. HS-6 attenuated the pressor response resulting from carotid occlusion and the depressor effect of vagal stimulation. Doses of HS-6 below those used to protect against soman in different animal species (10--30 mumol/kg) progressively blocked the ganglion-stimulating effects of nicotine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium but not the pressor effect following adrenaline, a pattern similar to that produced by hexamethonium but only 1/84 as potent. HS-6, like hexamethonium and mecamylamine, progressively blocked the contraction of the nictitating membrane of the cat resulting from preganglionic stimulation. The results indicate that HS-6 possesses ganglion-blocking properties at doses likely to be used in the protection against soman poisoning. The ganglion-blocking properties of the drug may be a factor in the beneficial effects of HS-6.

The effect of iontophoretically applied flurazepam on the spike activity of pericruciate cortical neurones of the cat was studied. Flurazepam increased cortical inhibition produced either by local electrical stimulation (which is known to release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or by iontophoretically applied GABA. Following intravenous treatment with thiosemicarbazide (a GABA-synthesis inhibitor), flurazepam still augmented the action of GABA but was much less effective on electrically evoked cortical inhibition. These findings suggest that part of the action of flurazepam on inhibitory cortical transmission might be at the presynaptic level.

Intracellular injections of noradrenaline or dopamine in spinal motoneurones of cats have a clear depolarizing action associated with particularly marked depression of spike potentials and their after-hyperpolarization, but with little slowing-down of the falling phase of the action potential. These effects are associated with an increase in input resistance, and they are reversible and reproducible in the same neurone. Intracellular injections of 5-hydroxytryptamine have some depolarizing action and increased input resistance, but they produced no comparable depression of the action potential and tended to enhance the after-potentials and increase excitability. It is concluded that changes in intracellular levels of monoamines, whether physiological or drug induced, may be of significance for central neuronal function.

A moderately halophilic Acinetobacter sp., capable of producing dextrinogenic amylase, was isolated from sea-sands. Maximum enzyme production was obtained when the bacterium was cultivated aerobically in media containing 1 to 2M NaCl or 1M KCl. Two kinds of amylase, amylases I and II were purified from the culture filtrate to an electrophoretically homogenous state by glycogen-complex formation, DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography, and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. Both enzymes had maximal activity at pH 7.0 in 0.2 to 0.6 M NaCl or KCl at 50 to 55 degrees C. The activities were lost by dialysis against distilled water. Molecular weights for amylases I and II were estimated to be 55 000 and 65 000 respectively by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The action pattern on amylose, soluble starch, and glycogen showed that the products were maltose and maltotriose.

The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the effects of certain antianxiety agents, that is, minor tranquilizers, sedatives, and hypnotics, on relaxation training. Twelve inpatients and two outpatients were referred to group relaxation training because of tension-anxiety complaints and underwent three training sessions. Results for those patients who were not having any psychotropic medication (Relaxation Only group) were compared with results for those who were receiving anxiolytic drugs (Medication-Relaxation group). Patients in the second group were on antianxiety medication prior to and during relaxation training. Self-report measures indicate that the Relaxation Only group benefited more from relaxation training and showed more treatment generalization effects. The results are interpreted as lending some support to the view that antianxiety drugs may have an interfering effect on relaxation training. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed.

The search for a treatment of tardive dyskinesia has generally been guided by the putative biochemical mechanisms underlying the extrapyramidal disorders, but no markedly effective treatment has yet been found. The currently postulated mechanism in tardive dyskinesia involves namely an imbalance between the central dopamine-acetylcholine systems whose balance may also be influenced by neuroendocrine factors. The agents reported having some clinical efficacy in the management of this neurological complication act on these systems. The clinical investigation for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia is laborious and raises several problems that could account for the unpredictability and the discrepancies in results. These problems can be divided into three broad categories: patient variables, experimental treatment variables and methodological variables. These variables are discussed and some suggestions made.

Combinations of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), pregnancy-associated macroglobulin (PAM) and placenta-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) were studied in groups of patients with ovarian and cervical cancer. In ovarian cancer, only CEA and PLAP levels appeared to reflect tumor burden and were complementary in detecting active disease. In cervical cancer, CEA and GGT reflected tumor burden, while PLAP showed just the reverse--the highest degree of positivity being present in minimal disease. PLAP positivity was even more pronounced in patients with cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ while CEA and GGT were negative. The data indicate that the use of marker combinations can improve our capacity to detect minimal disease and provide information regarding tumor biology that may not be available by studying individual markers or by other means. It remains to be determined whether the use of tumor markers can influence existing therapy sufficiently to alter the outcome in cancers which are notoriously difficult to treat.

A pure seminoma in a 12-year-old boy with an undescended testis and 46 XY/45 XO karyotype is presented. The relationships between an undescended testis, an abnormal karyotype, dysgenetic gonads and cancer are discussed.

Suspensions of isolated basal bodies undergo a characteristic decrease in turbidity following their exposure to 10(-3) M ATP. Typically, turbidity changes range from 8% to 20%, depending on the preparation, with an average change of 12%. Nucleotides other than ATP did not cause a turbidity decrease. The reaction has a pH optimum of pH 8.5 and is inhibited by concentrations of divalent cations greater than 2 X 10(-3) M. These results indicate that ATP induces a conformational change in the basal body that may be related to its activity in the cell.

Following the simultaneous subcutaneous administration of CdCl2 and Na2SeO3 to rats, evidence of a Cd-Se complex was detected in plasma by gel filtration chromatography. A similar complex was found in plasma after incubation of selenite, Cd, rat erythrocytes, and plasma in vitro, and after incubation of H2Se, Cd, and plasma in vitro. No interaction of selenite, selanete, or selenodiglutathione with Cd and plasma in the absence of erythrocytes in vitro was noted. Characterization by gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, and ammonium sulfate fractionation showed that these Cd-Se complexes are similar. The results support the hypothesis that H2Se or a similarly reduced selenide is the product of selenite metabolism by rat erythrocytes. Hydrogen selenide also altered the distribution of inorganic mercury in rat plasma in vitro in such a way that the apparent molecular weights of the Se-Hg and Cd-Se complexes associated with protein were similar. Hydrogen selenide had no effect upon the distribution of methylmercury in plasma. The stability of the Cd-Se complex in plasma depended upon the integrity of the native protein components, as shown by incubation with Proteinase K. The properties of the complex suggested that it existed in a single form associated with different plasma components under various conditions.

Eight disulfides (I-VIII) and a thiolsulfonate (IX) were promising blocking agents of lymphocytes in graft-versus-host reactions (GvHR) without comensurate intracellular effects. The blocking effects were assayed through inhibition of the local GvHR after parental lymphocytes had been incubated with agents at suitable concentrations and then inoculated into F1 hybrid offspring. The intracellular effects were assessed beforehand by measuring the inhibition of [6-3H]thymidine incorporation by lymphocytes in the presence of a wide range of concentrations of agents. Concentration levels which induced no greater than approx. 50% inhibition of the [6-3H] thymidine incorporation were considered to reflect sufficiently small intracellular effects and were used for the subsequent GvHR comparisons. Cellular survival always was 90% or more for the GvHR tests (unless stated otherwise), even when inhibition of thymidine incorporation was as high as 50%; hence the thymidine data are useful not only as guides for dose levels in the GvHR but also as leads to new agents that may show immunosuppressive or anti-leukemic activity through intracellular effects. Structural specificity of the active compounds as cell-surface poisons is evidenced by little or no activity (less than 30% inhibition of GvHR) of 28 other disulfides, 2 trisulfides, 2 Bunte salts, and 8 other thiolsulfonates. Active agents may owe this function to replacement of the H of SH in cell-surface thiol receptors by an SR group. Glutathione did not significantly inactivate agents, probably because the products of reaction also are active disulfides. When two agents (III, IX) were given orally or intraperitoneally to F1 hybrid recipients of untreated parental cells, doses of 10--15 mg/kg produced a GvHR inhibition of 17--53%.

The relevance of two direct techniques for monitoring of cellular function during tissue hypoxia has been evaluated. Tissue pH and cellular transmembrane potentials were registered in canine skeletal muscle during intestinal exteriorization shock and during prolonged local tourniquet ischemia. The obtained pH and transmembrane potential changes were correlated to simultaneous changes in high-energy phosphagen (ATP + CP) and lactate levels in skeletal muscle. In control dogs no significant changes in either of the studied variables occurred. Intestinal exteriorization shock as well as local tourniquet ischemia resulted in a gradual increase in tissue lactate and a concomitant decrease in tissue pH and transmembrane potentials. In both experimental situations there was a close correlation between the transmembrane potential reduction and the tissue lactate increase. Tissue pH registrations, on the other hand, did not similarly reveal the full extent of the tissue lactate increase under the two experimental conditions. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. On the basis of the present results it may therefore be concluded that the transmembrane potential seems to be a better variable for revealing the full extent of cellular metabolic deterioration during various situations with tissue hypoxia.

We found an acid extract of normal dog kidneys to contain two distinct molecular weight forms of renin-like activity. Gel filtration chromatography showed peaks of activity as estimated molecular weights of 65,000 and 41,000. The high molecular weight fraction (HMW) comprised only 1% of the total activity of the extract. Both HMW and low molecular weight (LMW) fractions were inhibited by anti-human renin antibody and had similar broad pH-dependent activity optima between pH 6.0 and 7.5 in homologous substrate. The Michaelis constant (Km) of HMW was 3.6 times the Km of LMW. Both renins bound reversibly to concanavalin A-Sepharose with comparable affinities. HMW and LMW eluted from DEAE-Sephadex at similar salt concentrations without conversion of HMW to LMW. Transient acidification effected partial conversion of HMW to LMW without changing the total activity. Preincubation of HMW with trypsin increased the activity 40% and effected complete conversion of HMW to LMW. The apparent molecular weight difference between HMW and LMW is probably due to a covalently bound fragment(s) and not to a noncovalently bound moiety such as has been described in the rabbit and the hog. Both HMW and LMW are glycoproteins whose terminal sugar constituents possibly are similar. HMW dog renin is a new molecular form of renin that is convertible to a more active lower molecular weight renin with tryptic proteolysis.

Combined H1 (cyproheptadine) and H2 antihistamines (cimetidine) were tried in eight patients with chronic urticaria who were previously unresponsive to conventional anti-urticarial regimens, including type I antihistamines, hydroxyzine, ephedrine and corticosteroids. 50% of the patients responded with 90% or greater improvement within 10 days. The remaining 50% showed no benefit. Side effects of the medications were minimal. These results indicate that a 10 day trial of both H1 and H2 antihistamines may be useful in patients with chronic urticaria resistant to all other standard treatment modalities.

A proposed reference method for serum creatinine has been developed under the auspices of the Committee on Reference Methods and Reference Materials of the Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. A serum ultrafiltrate at pH 2.0 is applied through a closed sample loop injection system to a short column containing cationic resin of high resolving power. Elution with sodium citrate buffer by means of minipump at constant rate passes the eluate into alkaline picrate reagents in a continuous flow system (Technicon AAIII pump, AAII colorimeter 50 mm x 1.5 mm flow cell, narrow band width filter). The colour reaction peak is monitored visually to verify specificity and the area is calculated electronically. Specificity has been demonstrated by use of Jaffé-reactive substances such as glucose, sodium acetoacetate, L-ascorbic acid, pyruvic acid, L-dopa and glycocyamidine and also by use of an alternate colour reaction, sodium 3,5-dinitrobenzoate in place of alkaline picrate in the analysis of serum pools. Routine methods in common use, i.e., manual and automated alkaline picrate procedures, demonstrated a statistically significant high bias in interlaboratory studies in which this procedure was used for reference.

Analytical isoelectric focusing on cellulose acetate membranes offers greater resolution of the enzyme pattern than does standard electrophoresis and offers numerous advantages over other support media in isoelectric focusing. A series of lysosomal enzymes, deficiencies of which cause lethal storage diseases in infants and children, can be shown to exist as multiple molecular forms by analytical isoelectrical focusing on cellulose acetate membranes. This analytical technique should be a valuable tool in the investigation of enzyme polymorphism and genetically determined enzyme deficiency diseases.

A new method for free thyroxine-binding sites on thyroxine-binding globulin has been described. This method for thyroxine-binding capacity has the virtues of reasonable specificity and convenience for routine use. When used with serum thyroxine levels it should be valuable in the calculation of free thyroxine and total thyroxine-binding globulin. A more directly estimated TBC as reported here should have more value than the various and more empirical T3 uptake methods.

A new automated method is proposed for the accurate determination of the true creatinine concentration in 20 microliter serum, based on the measurement of the initial rate of the decomposition reaction of the creatinine picrate complex caused by decreasing the pH. The results of this method, performed with a Centrifichem centrifugal analyzer system (type 300 F), are compared with the results obtained by two other methods: a manual method based upon the adsorption on Fuller's earth, and the Auto Analyzer method. In these comparative studies special attention is paid to the analysis of sera containing low (normal) substrate concentrations. Calculation of the orthogonal regression between the results obtained by the adsorption method (x) and the proposed method (y) gave: y=0.97x +/- 5 mumol/l (x=91.3 mumol/l, y-93.5 mumol/l), while for the correlation coefficient (r) 0.9721 was found. All sera (n=113) had creatinine concentrations between 40 and 180 mumol/l.

It was demonstrated that angiotensin I-converting enzyme was excreted in human urine. The mean activity of the enzyme in normal urine was found to be 0.38 +/- 0.04 (S.E.M.) units/day (n = 18) and the enzymic activity correlated well with the concentration of the excreted sodium (r = 0.76, p less than 0.005). Urinary angiotensin I-converting enzyme was partially purified. Three different molecular weights of enzyme (greater than 400 000, 290 000 and 140 000) were demonstrated by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. The enzymic properties of these three enzymes were identical with those of angiotensin I-converting enzyme from human lung with regard to inhibitory effects (bradykinin potentiator c and Arg-Pro-Pro), Cl- dependency, pH optimum and KM value.

When calcium and bicarbonate ions were mixed at room temperature (approximately 20 degrees C) to give concentrations of 4 mmol/1 and 21 mmol/1 respectively and the pH of the solution was kept at 8.3, vaterite, a form of calcium carbonate, was precipitated almost immediately as spheres of diameter 45 micron. The crystallisation of this material could be slowed down by adding to the crystallising medium small amounts of pyrophosphate or citrate which often inhibit crystal growth. High concentrations of sodium chloride (90 mmol/1) did not, however, affect the reaction. Very small amounts of gallbladder bile from patients with only cholesterol on the surface of their gallstones inhibited the crystallisation of calcium carbonate, and the size of the spheres was only 0.37 times those produced in water. The activity of the bile could be attributed to material with a molecular weight greater than 10 000. On the other hand, bile from patients having some calcium carbonate on the gallstone surface had less activity than comparable amounts of bile from patients with only cholesterol in this area. The active material may, therefore, play a part in preventing the deposition of calcium carbonate in gallstones.

In two different laboratories ionized calcium was determined by use of a calcium selective electrode system of recent design in specimens of whole blood drawn from a total of 100 volunteers. Identical mean values were obtained in each laboratory. A small standard deviation was found supporting the view that [Ca2+] is normally maintained within a narrow range. Ancillary factors in [Ca2+] determination were evaluated, including effects of in-vivo produced changes in pH, and effects of addition of small amounts of heparin to the whole blood sample. A veno-arterial difference in [Ca2+] was insignificant.

Hypothalamic regulation of prolactin secretion in animals (mammals) and man appears to be similar, and no significant differences have yet been demonstrated. The hypothalamus contains neurotransmitters and polypeptides that can either inhibit or stimulate prolactin release, although the predominant influence under basal conditions is to inhibit prolactin release. Thus pituitary stalk section or placement of lesions in the basal tuberal region of the hypothalamus results in increased prolactin release and sometimes in initiation of lactation. Among agents in the hypothalamus that can inhibit prolactin release, the most important appear to be an as yet unidentified polypeptide prolactin release inhibiting factor (PIF) and dopamine. There is some evidence that dopamine may account for most, if not all, of the prolactin release inhibiting activity of the hypothalamus. Agents that increase dopamine activity, i.e. L-dopa, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, etc., depress prolactin release. Acetylcholine also can inhibit prolactin release, but it appears to act via the catecholamines. Of the agents in the hypothalamus that stimulate prolactin release, the most important appear to be an as yet uncharacterized polypeptide prolactin releasing factor (PRF), thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and serotonin. TRH is as effective in releasing prolactin as in releasing TSH, but under most physiological states, TSH and prolactin release do not occur together. Serotonin and its precursors, tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan, are powerful releasors of prolactin and have been shown to be involved in some physiological states in which prolactin is released, i.e. during suckling, stress, etc. Other agents in the hypothalamus that can stimulate prolactin release include GABA and some prostaglandins, but these have not yet been shown to be involved in physiological control of prolactin secretion. Exteroceptive stimuli that alter prolactin release act through the CNS and hypothalamus, but some hormones and drugs also can act directly on the pituitary to promote or depress prolactin release.

Treatment of 6 healthy adult men with a beta-blocker, timolol, resulted in a rise in serum phosphate which was maintained for the 5 days of therapy. This rise was accompanied by a transient fall in urine phosphate and a rise in the tubular maximum for phosphate reabsorption per unit glomerular filtration rate (TmPO4/GFR). No change in circulating parathyroid hormone or growth hormone could be demonstrated.

Psychotropic drugs such as the phenothiazine neuroleptics and tricyclic antidepressants are known to cause electrocardiographic abnormalities as well as a central anticholinergic syndrome. Physostigmine is known to reverse the central muscarinic anticholinergic manifestations by inhibition of the enzyme cholinesterase. An unusual case of trifluoperazine overdose, in which the patient presented with cardiac arrhythmias and a central anticholinergic syndrome, is presented. Treatment with physostigmine reversed the central anticholinergic syndrome as well as the electrocardiographic abnormalities. Effects of phenothiazines on altering cardiac status are also discussed.

Representative studies which elucidate present treatment principles regarding parenteral administration of neuroleptics for acute psychoses with agitation are reviewed. "Rapid tranquillization" with drugs such as haloperidol generally appears preferable, but controlled comparisons with more conservative types of treatment are lacking. It is suggested that parenteral chlorpromazine should be avoided because of its tendency to provoke severe hypotension, whereas loxapine apparently is a valuable drug if strong sedation is required for behavioural control. Possible advantages of ultra-high-dose therapy need to be proved in controlled trials, and the occurrence of toxic side-effects requires further evaluation. From an ethical and psychological point of view, it is recommended that antiparkinsonian medication should be administered simultaneously with neuroleptics which induce a high incidence of acute dystonia. Several types of acute psychosis with agitation which do not require treatment with a neuroleptic as drug treatment of first choice are briefly mentioned.

An open study was carried out in 21 chronic alcoholics with severe withdrawal symptoms and incipient delirium tremens to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant treatment with intramuscular lorazepam (5mg). All symptoms subsided within 2 hours after a single injection and remained under control with oral lorazepam (mean daily dose 7 mg). No adverse reactions attributable to lorazepam were observed.

A double-blind crossover trial was carried out in 31 hospitalized elderly patients receiving night-time sedation to compare the effects of flunitrazepam (0.5 mg) and meprobamate (200 mg). After 1 week on placebo, patients received 1-week's treatment with each drug in random order. Quality of sleep was assessed by a nurse at hourly intervals over 8 hours each night. In 11 patients, the results were compared with those from kymographic recordings measuring patient restlessness (motility index). No statistically significant difference was found between the two active drug treatments, and there was a close correlation between the two methods of assessment. It is suggested that the kymograph may well be a useful and economic method of evaluating the effectiveness of hypnotics.

The disposition and metabolism of 6,11-dihydro-11-oxodibenz[be]oxepin-2-acetic acid (isoxepac), a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, has been studied in rat, rabbit, dog, rhesus monkey, and man. Animals were given single oral or parenteral doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg; man received approximately 3 mg/kg orally. Fecal excretion of radioactivity occurred in the rat (26--37%) and dog (33--49%), whereas in the other species elimination was mainly urinary (less than 83%). Biliary excretion accounted for 18--52% of the dose in the rat and dog. Enterohepatic circulation was demonstrated in both species. Plasma of all species was found to contain mainly unchanged isoxepac. The compound was rapidly eliminated from plasma of dog, rhesus monkey and man, but was more slowly eliminated in rat and rabbit. In the rabbit and dog the principal metabolites were the glycine and taurine conjugates of isoxepac, respectively, whereas in the rhesus monkey and man, isoxepac was excreted unchanged or as the glucuronide.

The physiological dispositon of ellipticine (NSC 71795) has been studied in the mouse, rat, dog and monkey after administration of [1-14C]ellipticine at 6 mg/kg iv (3 mg/kg to monkey). Ellipticine was very rapidly distributed from the blood of all species and was deposited in tissues. The rate of elimination of ellipticine from blood was species-dependent, half-times ranging from 22 min in mouse to 210 min in rat, and probably reflected the rate of metabolism of the drug. The rate of elimination of metabolites from blood was also species-dependent, half-times ranging from 140 min in mouse to 380 min in rat, and probably reflected the rate of biliary secretion of the metabolites. Ellipticine was widely but not uniformly distributed throughout the tissues including brain, and some of the highest concentrations of drug and metabolites were in liver, which is probably the primary site of metabolism. The concentrations of ellipticine and metabolites in tissues were species-dependent, correlating with species differences in rates of metabolism and excretion. All species excreted 80% of the dose via the fecal route and 10% via the urinary route, primarily as metabolites during the first 24 hr after dosing. Metabolites entered the gastrointestinal tract by biliary secretion and ellipticine entered by an ion-trapping mechanism. Evidence is presented that the major pathway for ellipticine metabolism in rat was to 9-hydroxyellipticine, which did not accumulate in liver but was conjugated to its glucuronide and sulfate, which were secreted in bile. Other pathways involved hydroxylation and glucuronide conjugation. The pharmacokinetics of ellipticine are correlated with its toxic side effects, such as acute hypotention and neurological symptoms. They are also correlated with its potential as an antitumor agent, such as its ability to achieve values for the area under the curve of concentration vs. time (CXt) in tumors, which would be adequate for therapy. Based upon these correlations, the drug should be administered in the clinic by iv infusion, or, provided its bioavailability is found to be satisfactory, by the oral route.

After ingestion of 400 mg of mescaline sulfate by human volunteers, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid was isolated from urine and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The amount of this anionic mescaline metabolite was found to be very low as compared with that of the well-konwn 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetic acid. The significance of this finding is discussed.

Some factors affecting the metabolism of the potent hepatotoxin, acetylhydrazine, were studied in rats. After ip administration of [14C]acetylhydrazine, 36% and 38% of the dose was recovered in the urine and as 14CO2, respectively. The major urinary metabolites were diacetylhydrazine and the pyruvic acid and alpha-oxoglutaric acid acetylhydrazones. The acetylation of acetylhydrazine to diacetylhydrazine was found to be dose-dependent and to be inhibited by coadministered isoniazid and p-aminosalicylic acid. Coadministered acetylisoniazid had no effect on acetylation. The proportion of acetylhydrazine recovered as 14CO2 presumably reflects the amount metabolized by the microsomal oxidation pathway, thought to be responsible for the toxicity, and also possibly by hydrolysis to acetate and hydrazine. This latter pathway could not be confirmed, as only a small proportion of hydrazine administered to rats was recovered. The inhibition of acetylation by p-aminosalicyclic acid, but not isoniazid, significantly increased the excretion of 14CO2, suggesting that isoniazid may also inhibit a pathway resulting in the production of 14CO2. These results indicate that the metabolism and hepatotoxicity of acetylhydrazine may be different when it is produced as a metabolite of isoniazid than when it is given alone.

A major metabolite of ciclobendazole (methyl 5-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-benzimidazolecarbamate) excreted in the urine, bile, and feces of rats was methyl 5-cyclopropylcarbonyl-6-hydroxy-benzimidazolecarbamate, established by comparison of the proton magnetic resonance and mass spectra with that of the authentic compound. This compound represented 8.2% and 7.1% of the dose, respectively, in extracts of 24-hr urine and 48-hr feces samples of rats, but was only a minor metabolite in dog urine (1% of the dose). The unchanged drug was only detected in dog feces, the major route of excretion of radioactivity in the dog. 5-Cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-amino-benzimidazole was present in rat urine (2.5% of the dose). A major metabolite in dog bile was probably 5-cyclopropylcarbinol-2-aminobenzimidazole, formed by loss of the methoxycarbonyl group and reduction of the carbonyl function in the 5-position.

The protective anti-asthmatic effect of a new anti-allergic drug with histaminolytic and anti-anaphylactic properties was tested in various controlled clinical studies of induced bronchospasm in asthmatic patients (provocation tests using a histamine aerosol, and exercise-induced asthma using a bicycle ergometer). The drug, ketotifen (a cycloheptathiophene derivative) was compared with a classical antihistaminic (clemastine) and a known cell stabiliser (disodium cromoglycate). In both models ketotifen provided significant protection.

The two major metabolites of ellipticine (NSC 71795) were isolated from rat bile by a combination of solvent extraction, partition column chromatography, and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Purification and structural elucidation of the bile products were aided by administration of the drug with a dual label (14C and 2H). The two metabolites were shown to be the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of 9-hydroxyellipticine by chemical, enzymatic, and mass-spectral fragmentation comparison with synthetic and enzymatically prepared reference compounds.

Administration of haloforms (trihalomethanes) to rats led to substantial elevations in blood carbon monoxide levels. The administration of 13C-bromoform led to the formation of similarly enriched 13CO. A dose-dependent relationship between bromoform dose and CO production was observed. It was found that phenobarbital, but not 3-methylcholanthrene, treatment increased the blood CO levels seen after the administration of bromoform as compared to saline-treated controls. Lower blood CO levels were found in rats given 2H-bromoform as compared to rats given bromoform. Furthermore, SKF 525-A significantly inhibited the in vivo metabolism of bromoform to CO. Administration of either diethyl maleate or D-penicillamine did not alter the blood CO levels produced in response to bromoform administration. The in vivo metabolism of haloforms to CO followed the halide order; thus, administration of iodoform yielded the highest blood CO levels, whereas chloroform yielded the lowest levels.

The author goes briefly over the metabolism of the main cerebral monoamines, the functioning of synapses, as well as the methods used in studying the biochemistry of depression. Beyond all existing contradictory results, a review of the main works in this field enables us to point out some leading ideas:--Depression would be due to and/or accompanied by a monoaminergic deficiency: some authors emphasize the serotonin one, others the noradrenaline one.--The regulation of mood most probably finds its origin in the monoaminergic balance, rather than in the gross rates of any particular monoamine.--Disturbances are to be found on all metabolic levels: monoaminergic, hydroelectrolytic, hormonal, glucidic, lipidic, lipidic... Close intrication exists between those different metabolisms.--The interaction between the different aminergic systems and the metabolic ways, as well as the dispersion of the acknowledged results, impose more and more the necessity of a biochemical typology of depression, which would lead to a predictive approach to the evolution and treatment of depressive illness.

The partial purification of rat and calf liver dihydropyrimidinase (EC 3.5.2.2) is described. Molecular weights of the native calf and rat liver enzymes were estimated by gel-filtration chromatography to be 252,000 and 266,000 daltons, respectively. Subunit molecular weights of the calf and rat liver enzyme were estimated by SDS-gel electrophoresis to be 59,000 and 62,000 daltons, respectively. The native enzyme in both species is thought to comprise four subunits. The purified enzyme from both species was capable of catalyzing the hydrolytic ring opening of dihydrouracil, 5-phenylhydantoin, hydantoin, and alpha-phenylsuccinimide.

Hepatic blood flow can be estimated from the area under the blood or plasma concentration-time curve of a drug following an intravenous dose and either an oral or intraperitoneal dose. The validity of the method depends on several factors which alter the area under the curve, that is, hemodynamic interactions due to the drug or its metabolites, the use of plasma concentration as opposed to blood concentration data, incomplete absorption on oral or intraperitoneal administration, enterohepatic recycling of the drug or its metabolite, and the presence of extrahepatic metabolism. The validity of the method was tested in rats with tracer doses of acetaminophen. After the simultaneous administration of an iv dose of 14C-acetaminophen and an intraportal dose of 3H-acetaminophen to rats, the availability after the first-pass hepatic extraction of acetaminophen in rats was 0.56 +/- 0.05. Hepatic blood flow estimated by the area under the curve for the respective routes of administration was 78.1 +/- 16.1 ml/min/kg. However, after the simultaneous administration of an iv tracer dose of 14C-acetaminophen and an ip dose of 3H-acetaminophen, the apparent availabilities calculated from the areas under the curve were highly variable and tended to be greater (0.73 +/- 0.11). Thus the estimates of the hepatic blood flow also tended to be higher (159 +/- 65 ml/min/kg).

VIP stimulates lipolysis and adenyl cyclase activity in the rat adipose tissue. VIP-induced lipolysis and adenyl cyclase activity are not affected by phenoxybenzamine. VIP-induced lipolysis is inhibited by propranolol but VIP-induced adenyl cyclase activity is not.

The incubation of methimazole (1-methyl-2-thioimidazole, MMI) with rat hepatic microsomes led to the formation of 3-methyl-2-thiohydantoin and N-methylimidazole. In addition, an NADPH-stimulated binding of 14C and 35S from [14C]- and [35s]MMI to microsomal macromolecules was seen. Both the NADPH-stimulated N-methylimidazole formation and binding of radioactivity from [14C]- and [35S]MMI to microsomal macromolecules appeared to be catalyzed largely by the cytocrhome P-450 to monoxygenase systems of rat hepatic microsomes. A portion of the radioactivity bound to microsomes incubated with [14C]- and [35S]MMI was released as unchanged MMI on prolonged incubation under acid conditions; this suggests that strong binding of MMI to microsomes occurred. A portion of the 35S bound to microsomes incubated with [35S]MMI can be released as 35SCN- on incubation of the 35S-labeled microsomes with CN-. These data suggest that a portion of the sulfur released in the metabolism of MMI to N-methylimidazole is in the form of atomic sulfur (S), which binds to cysteine sulfhydryl groups (R-S-H) in microsomal proteins to form a hydrodisulfide (R-S-S-H).

Hexosamine isomerase from pig intestinal mucosa was purified about 70-fold. The aminosugar product of the enzymatic reaction was identified as glucosamine 6-phosphate and amino acid product as glutamic acid. The pH optimum was 7.1 Km for fructose 6-phosphate was 6.3 X 10(-4) mol/1 and for L-glutamine 6.5 X 10(-4) mol/1.

The chemical carcinogen hydrazine is a potent stimulator of guanylate cyclase. In the present investigation we found that three chemical carcinogens structurally related to hydrazine, isonicotinic acid hydrazide, hydrazine sulfate, and dimethylhydrazine, decreased guanylate cyclase activity. It is of interest that hydrazine has been shown to increase DNA synthesis whereas isonicotinic acid hydrazide, hydrazine sulfate, and dimethylhydrazine decrease DNA synthesis. The relationship, if any, linking the guanylate cyclase-cyclic GMP system to DNA synthesis and carcinogenesis remains to be explored.

The nucleotide cyclic GMP has been reported to be involved in cell proliferation and malignant transformation. Nitroso chemical carcinogens activate the enzyme guanylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.2) which catalyzes the production of cyclic GMP. The present investigation demonstrates that compounds from other major classes of carcinogens including (1) alpha-halo ethers (chloromethyl methyl ether); (2) aromatic amines (benzidine and B-naphthylamine); (3) polycyclic hydrocarbons (1,2-benzanthracene and acridine); (4) azo dyes (p-dimethylaminoazobenzene), and (5) aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, G2) produced a striking and significant inhibition of guanylate cyclase over a general concentration range of 0.5-13 mmol/1 in a variety of tissues. Some of the nitrosamides which increase guanylate cyclase activity, increase DNA synthesis whereas carcinogens which decrease guanylate cyclase activity inhibit DNA or RNA synthesis suggesting a relationship between cyclic GMP, DNA synthesis, and chemical carcinogenesis.

The first part of this essay discussed the CNS effects of the pituitary peptide MSH. These investigations anticipated studies of the CNS effects of peptides found in the hypothalamus which were discussed in the second part of the essay. Some of the endocrine actions of the hypothalamic peptides upon the release of pituitary hormones were discussed in the last part of the essay. Together, the CNS and pituitary effects of hypothalamic peptides and MSH provide intriguing examples of areas of investigation which can be expected to be greatly expanded in the future.

In this paper experiments are reported which show evidence for a relation between quaternary structure and catalytic activity of cytoplasmic NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase from beef liver. The inactivation of the enzyme occurring upon dilution and the plots of the catalytic activity versus the enzyme concentration indicate that the monomeric species is catalytically inactive and that the monomer-dimer equilibrium is shifted towards the dimer upon binding of the substrate magnesium isocitrate complex. The association of the enzyme following binding of the substrate takes place at a rate comparable with that of the enzymatic reaction, which results in a 'hysteretic' behaviour of the enzyme. The possibility is discussed that slow changes in quaternary structure can give rise to a physiological regulation of the enzymatic activity.

The 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of melanostatin (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) and related peptides (Pro-Leu-Gly, Z-Pro-Leu-Gly, Z-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 and Z-Pro-Leu-Gly-OCH3, where Z = benzyloxycarbonyl) were analysed in a variety of solvents. At physiological pH, the melanostatin molecule is N-protonated in aqueous solution. The concentration dependences of the chemical shifts of amide-proton and carbonyl-carbon resonances and of proton spin-lattice relaxation times were observed in relation to molecular aggregations. In dimethylsulfoxide solution, aggregations were observed for N-protonated melanostatin and Pro-Leu-Gly prepared with HCl and for the Na salt of Z-Pro-Leu-Gly but not for N-protonated melanostatin prepared with HClO4 or HNO3, unprotonated melanostatin, Z-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2, or Z-Pro-Leu-Gly-OCH3. The leucine NH and glycine CO groups of N-protonated melanostatin are involved in the intermolecular hydrogen bonds of aggregates. The leucine NH group of N-protonated Pro-Leu-Gly also forms the intermolecular hydrogen bond. The solvent and temperature dependences of the chemical shifts of amide-proton and carbonyl-carbon resonances were measured to determine intramolecular hydrogen bonding. In dimethylsulfoxide solution, N-protonated melanostatin molecules in part take the beta-turn structure and the trans carboxamide NH proton and carbonyl oxygen of the proline residue form an intramolecular hydrogen bond.

Incubation of pig heart NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase with ethoxyformic anhydride (diethylpyrocarbonate) at pH 6.2 results in a 9-fold greater rate of loss of dehydrogenase than of oxalosuccinate decarboxylase activity. The rate constants for loss of dehydrogenase and decarboxylase activities depend on the basic form of ionizable groups with pK values of 5.67 and 7.05, respectively, suggesting that inactivation of the two catalytic functions results from reaction with different amino acid residues. The rate of loss of dehydrogenase activity is decreased only slightly in the presence of manganous isocitrate, but is reduced up to 10-fold by addition of the coenzymes or coenzyme analogues, such as 2'-phosphoadenosine 5'-diphosphoribose (Rib-P2-Ado-P). Enzyme modified at pH 5.8 fails to bind NADPH, but exhibits manganese-enhanced isocitrate binding typical of native enzyme, indicating that reaction takes place in the region of the nucleotide binding site. Dissociation constants for enzyme . coenzyme-analogue complexes have been calculated from the decrease in the rate of inactivation as a function of analogue concentration. In the presence of isocitrate, activating metals (Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+) decrease the Kd value for enzyme . Rib-P2-Ado-P, while the inhibitor Ca2+ increases Kd. The strengthened binding of nucleotide produced by activating metal-isocitrate complexes may be essential for the catalytic reaction, reflecting an optimal orientation of NADP+ to facilitate hydride transfer. Measurements of ethoxyformyl-histidine formation at 240 nm and of incorporation of [14C]ethoxy groups in the presence and absence of Rib-P2-Ado-P indicate that loss of activity may be related to modification of approximately one histidine. The critical histidine appears to be located in the nucleotide binding site in a region distal from the substrate binding site.

Tissue hypoxia was induced in pigs by artificial ventilation with 6% O2 in N2 for 18 min. Base deficit, lactate and hypoxanthine increased linearily during this period, and were significantly higher than initial values in the course of 6 min of hypoxemia. High correlation coefficients between hypoxanthine and lactate (mean 0.98) and between hypoxanthine and base deficit (mean 0.98) were found. During the recovery period when the animals were ventilated with air, high correlation coefficients between lactate and hypoxanthine (mean 0.75) and between base deficit and hypoxanthine (mean 0.83) were also found. It is concluded that plasma hypoxanthine concentrations should be used to assess tissue hypoxia also in clinical situations.

In mice, the plaque-forming cell response to sheep red blood cells was stimulated by a mixture of methoxy-substituted glycerol ethers isolated from Greenland shark liver oil and by synthetic 1-0-(2-methoxyhexadecyl)-glycerol, given in the diet. In preliminary experiments, this synthetic compound also increased the ability of parental spleen cells to induce graft-vs.-host reactions in F1 hybrid mice. Glycerol ethers occur in the bone marrow fat of mammals and in the membrane phospholipids. It is postulated that the methoxy-substituted glycerol ethers supplied in the diet may stimulate the bone marrow and/or may be incorporated into membrane lipids, thereby changing the structure and function of the membranes.

As is observed clinically, cessation of chronic clonidine treatment in the rat results in a syndrome characterized by sympathetic hyperactivity. After three weeks of chronic oral administration of clonidine, tyrosine hydroxylase (TOH) activity was unchanged in superior cervical ganglia and locus coeruleus, but was reduced (45%) in the celiac ganglia. Abrupt cessation of treatment resulted in increases in TOH activity in superior cervical and celiac ganglia (to 135 and 250% of controls) and in the locus coeruleus (170% of control). These data suggest a selective effect of clonidine treatment and withdrawal on vasomotor fibers. A mechanism explaining physical dependence on clonidine is proposed.

The effect of intracisternal (i.c.m.) injection of clonidine, noradrenaline, and piperoxane on the pressor response to electrical stimulation of a peripheral somatic afferent nerve was investigated using anaesthetized cats. It was found that noradrenaline caused a depression of the magnitude of the pressor response and this effect was antagonized by subsequent injection of piperoxane i.c.m. In contrast, clonidine had no significant effect on the magnitude of the somatic pressor reflex but caused a dose-dependent prolongation of the reflex after cessation of nerve stimulation. This prolongation was antagonized by piperoxane which also caused an increase in the magnitude of the reflex. Piperoxane alone had no significant effect on the magnitude or duration of the reflex. Neither magnitude nor duration of the somatic pressor reflex was influenced significantly by a reduction in resting blood pressure. It is suggested that clonidine and noradrenaline act at different sites within the central nervous system to produce qualitatively different changes in the efferent sympathetic discharge pattern modulating the somatic pressor reflex.

Following reports that unilateral intranigral injections of putative GABAergic drugs induce contralateral rotational behaviour in rats, the effects of similar injections of the benzodiazepine flurazepam have been studied. Flurazepam mimicked the effects of the GABA agonist muscimol and the GABA analogue baclofen by inducing a dose-related contralateral rotation. This response was anatomically associated with the GABA-rich zona reticulata of the substantia nigra and was attenuated by the GABA antagonist picrotoxin but not by the dopamine antagonist haloperidol or by destruction of the ipsilateral nigrostriatal dopamine pathway with 6-hydroxydopamine. These results suggest that in this behavioural model flurazepam may show GABAergic activity by indirectly enhancing GABA transmission at synapses with receptors located on nigral non-dopaminergic neurons controlling postural asymmetry.

HgCl2 and mersalyl increased and later decreased both the spontaneous and evoked transmitter liberation at the frog neuromuscular junction. Lower concentration of HgCl2 exhibited only an inhibitory effect on transmitter release. These mercurials inhibited calcium transport of mitochondria and synaptosomal vesicles. Lower concentrations of HgCl2 showed a stimulatory effect on mitochondrial calcium uptake. It is suggested that the effect of mercurials on transmitter release is mediated via changes of the intracellular calcium ion concentration.

The fact that drinking in response to some hypovolemic stimuli was attenuated by nephrectomy but not by ureteric ligation led to the suggestion that the renal renin-angiotensin system may play a role in hypovolemic thirst. The isolation of a thirst factor from the kidney and the demonstration that this substance was renin supported the hypothesis. Subsequently, it was shown that the effects of renin on drinking were mediated through angiotensin II, which proved to be a potent dipsogenic substance when administered systemically or injected directly into the brain. Recently, it has been shown that angiotensin II, infused intravenously or through the carotid artery at rates that produce increases in plasma angiotensin II levels similar to those that occur in mild sodium depletion, causes the water-replete animal to drink. This discovery establishes that angiotensin is a physiological stimulus to drinking but it leaves open the question of the extent of the involvement of renal renin in normal thirst. Other unsolved problems are the role of cerebral isorenin in angiotensin thirst and its relationship with renal renin, and in view of its stimulating action on sodium intake when infused into the brain, whether angiotensin plays a significant role in sodium appetite.

The previous demonstration that sperm kept at body temperature (37 degrees C) had a marked deterioration in motility accompanied by an overgrowth of bacteria in the semen and a concomitant decrease in pH led to this study to test the hypothesis that the decrease in motility was caused by the bacteria or by bacterial alteration of seminal pH. Semen specimens from fertile prevasectomy patients with and without added antibiotics were maintained at 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C and evaluated at 3, 12, and 18 hours after collection. There was still a significant deterioration in spermatozoal motility in the samples kept at 37 degrees C even when bacterial growth and change in pH were prevented by buffered antibiotics. Although the decrease in spermatozoal motility at body temperature may in part be attributed to bacterial growth or the products of bacterial metabolism, clearly another factor is present related to time and temperature and independent of the presence of bacteria.

The acid--forming, acid--neutralizing functions of the stomach, morphological state of its walls and level of histamine in the blood were studied in control rats and in rats subjected to continuous histamine administration. In the latter, intensive elevation of intragastric acidity in empty stomach, an increase in the histamine contents in the blood, and distrophic processes in the wall of stomach occurred. The functional--morphological data obtained suggest remarkable adaptational abilities of the stomach.

Endocrine cells of the gastric fundal and pyloric mucosa in patients suffering from gastric and duodenal ulcers with different gastric juice acidity, were studied. At hyperacid ulcers, the number of argyrhilic endocrine cells of gastric fundus was increased to 218 +/- 21.1 as compared with the normal acidity 164 +/- 14.8, while it was decreased to 97 +/- 15.1 as compared with hypoacidity. Argentaffinic cells were found in patients with hypo- and unacid gastric juice only. The electron microscopy revealed six types of endocrine cells (A-like, ECL, G, D, D1, EC). The ultrastructural changes of A-like, ECL, and G cells in patients with hyperacid gastric juice indicated their high functional activity. A balance seems to exist between activating and inhibiting systems of the endocrine apparatus of gastric mucosa which accounts for the hyperacidity of the gastric juice.

Hemolytic anemia is a well-recognized complication of sulfasalazine treatment. 17 of 40 (43%) patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving sulfasalazine had evidence of hemolysis as detected by starch gel electrophoresis. Only 47% (8) of patients with hemolysis had Heinz body formation. The hemoglobin was significantly reduced in patients with hemolysis and 53% had a reticulocyte count of greater than 5%. A significant correlation was noted between hemolysis and serum sulfapyridine level, but no correlation was seen with serum sulfasalazine level. There was no significant difference in disease extent or activity in patients with hemolysis compared to those without hemolysis. Hemolysis is not a rare side-effect of sulfasalazine therapy. Heinz body formation is not invariably found in sulfasalazine-induced hemolysis.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level in rectal mucosa excised from 17 patients suffering from ulcerative colitis was 2-fold higher than that found in rectal mucosa of 17 normal subjects: 2.0 +/- 0.4 and 0.9 +/- 0.2 ng per mg of wet tissue, respectively. Accumulation of PGE 2 in 24-hr cultures of rectal mucosa specimens obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis was 112% higher than that observed in cultures from control subjects. Addition of sulfasalazine, sulfapyridine, and 5-aminosalicylic, acid to the culture medium of ulcerative colitis mucosa resulted in inhibition of PGE2 production by 34, 32, and 62%, respectively, compared to rectal specimens cultured in drug-free medium. These results suggest that PGE may mediate the inflammatory response in ulcerative colitis and that some of the therapeutic effect of sulfasalazine and its constituents are related to the inhibition of PGE synthesis.

Covalent binding of 2-acetaminofluorene[9-14C] with exogenous Torula yeast RNA and endogenous protein was investigated in liver microsome system in vitro. The binding to protein was 100 times higher than that to RNA. Requirement of NADPH, effectiveness of methylcholanthrene treatment, and inhibition by 7,8-benzoflavone suggest possible involvement of mixed-function oxidases in this binding. The binding was not due to contaminated cytosol in the microsome fraction. Addition of cytosol, sulfate ion, and ATP diminished the binding. Parallel experiments using N-hydroxy-2-acetaminofluorene[9-14C] denied major contribution of this metabolite to the binding of 2-acetaminofluorene in the microsome system. Ring-hydroxylated product was suggested as a possible metabolite for the binding.

Intramural pH  of the gastric mucosa was measured using a microelectrode technique in rabbit gastric pouches under different secretory conditions and luminal acidity. Exposure of spontaneously secreting or metiamide-treated fundic pouches to a relatively high concentration of luminal acid. HCl 120 mM, for 60 min, led to a marked net loss of luminal H+ which was associated with a significant decrease in the intramural pH (7.28 +/- 0.09 to 6.88 +/- 0.10 and 7.23 +/- 0.07 to 6.99 +/- 0.09, respectively). A linear relationship was observed between the rates of net disappearance of luminal acid and the intramural pH. All 10 spontaneously secreting and five metiamide-treated pouches had superficial mucosal erosions. In contrast, when fundic pouches were exposed to luminal acid in histamine-treated animals, the net loss of luminal H+ was negligible and the intramural pH remained at its base-line level (7.25 +/- 0.07). Histamine stimulation without acid in the lumen caused a small but insignificant increase in the intramural pH (7.27 +/- 0.03 to 7.39 +/- 0.05). Only three of the eight histamine-treated fundic pouches had lesions. In the antral pouches the intramural pH changes in response to exposure to luminal acid were smaller and histamine treatment did not influence the intramural pH. None of the antral pouches had lesions. The results suggest that acidification of the tissue by the diffusion of luminal acid may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of acute gastric ulceration. The acid secretory state of the gastric mucosa can significantly influence the acid-base balance in the mucosa and thus modify its response to acid diffusing from the lumen. Histamine stimulation protected the gastric mucosa by improving its buffering capacity and/or otherwise decreasing the diffusion of H+ from the lumen into the mucosa.

In order to test the hypothesis that secretin may be released intermittently after feeding, the plasma secretin concentration was measured at short intervals, and the duodenal pH continuously recorded, after a liquid test meal in 10 human subjects. Secretin was measured with a radioimmunoassay in which the entire molecule is specifically recognized and the immunoreactivities of human secretin and of the porcine peptide used as standard are similar. In the total group, no significant variation of the mean plasma secretin concentration above basal was observed within 45 min after feeding. Analysis of the individual patterns revealed that secretin was released transiently in 5 of the 10 subjects, namely those showing variations of the duodenal pH down to or below 4.0 at some time after the meal. The mean peak delta secretin in these subjects was 7.2 pg ml-1 of plasma. In 7 additional subjects, bolus intravenous injections of 0.005 and 0.01 clinical units kg-1 of porcine secretin resulted in peak delta secretin concentrations of 5.5 and 10.5 pg ml-1, respectively, and were followed by a significant increase of bicarbonate output in the duodenal aspirate. These results indicate that secretin is released unevenly and intermittently in the early period after a liquid meal in man, in amounts that seem sufficient for the initiation of a significant bicarbonate response.

The incidence of gastroesophageal reflux was evaluated with the use of a pH probe in 12 patients with cirrhosis and recent variceal hemorrhage and in 15 healthy control subjects. Short episodes of reflux occurred in 42% of the patients and in 47% of the controls. During an observation period of 1 hr, the cumulative duration of reflux was similar in patients (2.5 +/- 1.3 min) and controls (3.1 +/- 1.4 min). Mean lower esophageal sphincter pressures were normal in both groups but did not show a significant correlation with the duration of reflux. These data support previous observations that gastroesophageal reflux dose not appear to be a contributing factor in the development of variceal hemorrhage.

The effects of luminal instillation of 16,16 dimethyl PGE2 (dmPGE2) on gastric acid secretion and back diffusion of H+ were studied in anaesthetised dogs which were prepared with a segment of the greater curvature of the stomach mounted in a double lumen chamber. This model permitted simultaneous evaluation of two segments of mucosa, one control and the other test, supplied by the same vascular pedicle. Imfusion of histamine (1.0 microgram/kg/min, intravenously) stimulated brisk acid secretion in both chambers. Topical application of 25 microgram dmPGE2 in 20 ml 0.3 M HC1 to the test chamber for 30 minutes prevented acid secretion from the test mucosa during a second histamine infusion. Since the control chamber showed no evidence of inhibition this indicates that dmPGE2 acted directly on the secretory cells, rather than after absorption from the bloodstream. This observation, however, does not exclude a possible local effect on mucosal blood flow. Direct exposure of the gastric mucosa to dmPGE2 increased the rate of back diffusion of H+ because of disruption of the permeability barrier, indicated by increased H+ back diffusion, Na+ efflux, and a reduction in potential difference. However, H+ loss was small compared to the reduction in acid output.

Gastric secretion and fasting plasma gastrin levels were investigated in 26 patients with bilharzial hepatic fibrosis and 26 controls. The groups did not differ in their basal secretion. When stimulated by intravenous infusion of histamine the maximal acid output in patients with bilharzial hepatic fibrosis was significantly less than in the control group. This was unlikely to be a result of neutralisation by reflux of alkaline duodenal contents as the volumes of reflux were not different from control subjects, but was compatible with a true reduction in gastric secretion as assessed by two-component hypothesis. Neither the lowered gastric acidity nor the liver damage in patients with bilharzial hepatic fibrosis correlated with circulating gastrin. The fasting levels of plasma gastrin in these patients were not different from controls. As in other liver diseases the cause of diminished gastric secretion remains unclear.

Median concentration of plasma secretin in the fasting state in 11 achlorhydria patients, 17 normal subjects, eight duodenal ulcer patients, and 11 Zollinger-Ellison patients was 0.3, 1.2, 2.5, and 5.9 pmol x 1(-1), respectively. Aspiration of gastric acid normal subjects and duodenal ulcer patients was followed by a significant lowering of the plasma secretin concentration. In normal subjects insulin-induced hypoglycaemia resulted in increased secretin levels when gastric acid was allowed to enter the duodenum, whereas no changes were observed when gastric acid was aspirated. Simultaneous measurements of intraduodenal pH and plasma secretin concentration in the fasting state and in response to a meal showed that rapid falls in intraduodenal pH were followed by short-lived increments in plasma secretin concentration. These changes in pH and in secretin levels were diminished after cimetidine. It is concluded that gastric acid in man does trigger release of secretin and that secretin is secreted intermittently both in the fasting state and in response to a meal when boluses of acid enter the duodenum.

Short chain fatty acid absorption from the human rectum has been studied in 46 subjects attending an obesity clinic, using a dialysis bag technique. From a mixed electrolyte solution, acetate concentrations fell from 97.0 to 64.2 mmol/l, and sodium from 97.8 to 85.1 mmol/l with respective net absorption rates of 8.1 and 5.2 mumol/cm2/h. From a solution with mixed short chain fatty acids acetate concentration fell from 62.3 to 37.6 mmol/l, propionate from 20.2 to 11.5 mmol/l, and butyrate from 25.7 to 17.3 mmol/l with absorption rates of 5.2, 1.8, and 1.9 mumol/cm2/h. Lowering pH from 7.2 to 5.5, to test the possibility that absorption occurred by passive non-ionic diffusion, had no effect on absorption rates, although pH rose rapidly in the dialysis fluid. These results are comparable with rates of acetate absorption from the animal large intestine. The hypothesis that short chain fatty acids are not absorbed from the large gut and therefore contribute to faecal bulk by retaining water in the bowel lumen may need revision.

Streptozotocin, a nitrosamide carcinogen, enhances the activity of guanylate cyclase. Six analogues of streptozotocin were studied in order to elucidate critical structure-activity relationships pertaining to the activation of guanylate cyclase. Analogue 1, known as chlorozotocin, has a nitroso group and increased guanylate cyclase activity 17 to 28-fold. Analogue III, which also has a nitroso group, but greater structural modifications with 4 acetate groups extending off of the glucose moiety, activated guanylate cyclase in colon but not in kidney. The other analogues (II,IV,VI, and VIII) lacking nitroso groups, either had no effect or produced mild decreases in guanylate cyclase activity.

Tetrameric rabbit muscle aldolase is dissociated to the inactive monomer at strongly alkaline pH (pH greater than or equal to 12). As shown by sedimentation velocity, fluorescence emission, and specific activity, the final profiles of dissociation, denaturation, and deactivation run parallel. Increasing incubation time proves the enzyme to be metastable in the pH range of deactivation. At 10 less than pH less than 12 "hysteresis" of the deactivation-reactivation reaction is observed. Short incubation at pH greater than or equal to 12 leads to high yields of reactivation (greater than or equal to 60%), while irreversibly denatured enzyme protein is the final product after long incubation. The kinetics of reconstitution under essentially irreversible conditions (pH 7.6) can be described by a sequential uni-bimolecular mechanism, assuming partial activity of the isolated subunits. The kinetic constants correspond to those observed for the reactivation after denaturation at acid pH or in 6M guanidine. HCl. Obviously the pH-dependent deactivation and reactivation of aldolase at alkaline pH obeys the general transconformation/association model which has been previously reported to hold for the reconstitution of numerous oligomeric enzymes after denaturation in various denaturants.

In rat-liver nuclei, isolated by the non-aqueous technique, the concentrations and labelling rates of the purine moiety of acid-soluble nucleotides were determined and compared with corresponding data for non-fractionated tissue and nuclei-free cytoplasm. Livers were used from untreated rats, from rats with a highly stimulated synthesis of NAD and from rats following a heavy metabolic load with adenosine. Under all circumstances, the nuclear and cytoplasmic concentrations of nucleotides (e.g. ATP and its dephosphorylated forms, pyridine nucleotides) and of free glucose were practically identical. Specific radioactivities after a pulse with formate also indicated a nucleo-cytoplasmic equilibrium for purine-containing nucleotides. It is concluded that precursor pools for nuclear biosyntheses as well as energy supply for other nuclear activities may be determined by an analysis of the non-fractionated tissue.

More than 250 cases of this puzzling illness, first described in Japan a decade ago, have now been reported in the United States. The etiology, epidemiology, and true incidence remain to be determined. But since some 2% of victims develop severe cardiac complications and some may die suddenly months after apparent complete recovery, pediatricians must now consider this entity in the differential diagnosis of protracted, febrile illness.

The pathology and cell biology of endocrine pancreatic tumors are reviewed. It is probable that all these tumors are "functioning" in the sense that they elaborate hormones that cause more or less conspicuous clinical syndromes. Identification of such secretory products is essential for an optimal diagnosis, localization, treatment, and follow-up. Recent data indicate that endocrine pancreatic tumors evolve from progenitor cells of ducts. This histogenetic mechanism may explain the occurrence not only of mixed or multihormonal tumors but also of tumors producing hormones that are absent from the adult human pancreas. In addition to their clinically apparent effects, many endocrine pancreatic tumors affect the surrounding endocrine pancreas in a characteristic way. The mechanisms behind and the potential diagnostic usefulness of these changes are discussed.

Mycobacterium ulcerans produces an exotoxin in culture which, when inoculated into guinea pig skin, causes inflammation, necrosis, edema, and other histopathological changes resembling those in infections of humans. The toxin was resistant to heat and to alkalies and was moderately acid labile. Toxic activity was destroyed by Pronase, phospholipase, lipase, amylase, and glucosidase but not by trypsin, collagenase, cellulase, lysozyme, hyaluronidase, or neuraminidase. Toxic activity was resistant to treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, urea, guanidine hydrochloride, p-chloromercuribenzoate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and sodium deoxycholate but was destroyed by sodium m-periodate and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The toxin was precipitated by a wide range of ammonium sulfate concentrations. Extraction with chlorofrom-methanol or petroleum ether destroyed its activity. Isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation in KBr produced a high-density lipoprotein layer with a 24-fold increase in specific activity. The results indicate that this toxin is a high-molecular-weight phospholipoprotein-polysaccharide complex.

Mutants of Streptococcus mutans were isolated which lack the enzyme activity L (+)-lactate dehydrogenase. Reversion studies indicate that the genetic defects are in the structural gene for the enzyme. The mutants produce less titratable acid from glucose, adhere better to hydroxyapatite, and accumulate more plaque when grown in the presence of sucrose than does the parent strain. These findings suggest a possible use for the mutants as effector strains in the replacement therapy of dental caries.

An easily performed assay to identify the C3b and Fc receptors on human neutrophils was developed. Salmonella typhimurium were treated with fluorescein and then incubated in nonimmune fresh human serum, which led to C3b fixation via activation of the alternative pathway. Similarly, type II pneumococci were treated with fluorescein and opsonized with type-specific rabbit antiserum. Neutrophils bearing C3b and Fc receptors formed rosettes with the respective bacteria, which were easily readable because of their bright fluorescence. Incubation of neutrophils at 37 degrees C with C3-coated bacteria generated 54 +/ 4% C3b rosettes, whereas neutrophils incubated with immunoglobulin G-coated bacteria yielded 75 +/ 7% rosettes. Incubation at 4 degrees C inhibited the formation of C3b rosettes but not Fc rosettes. Heat inactivation of the fresh human serum at 56 degrees C for 30 min completely inhibited the formation of the C3b rosettes, and addition of heat-aggregated immunoglobulin G to the polymorphonuclear leukocyte blocked the ability of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte to bind immunoglobulin G-coated bacteria. Addition of 1.0 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 0.1 mg of trypsin per ml, 10 mM H2O2, O2- generated by xanthine-xanthine oxidase, and 8 times 10(-4) M hydrocortisone inhibited the C3b receptor, but did not inhibit the Fc receptor. In neutrophils, the selective effect of the various inhibitors suggests that the Fc and C3b receptors are distinct entities.

Ribosomal vaccines prepared from Salmonella typhimurium were effective immunogens in A/J, C3H/HeDub, and C3H/HeJ mice. Purified ribosomal components were also tested as immunogens in the inbred mice. Protein isolated from a Salmonella ribosomal fraction could protect all three mouse strains. Although purified RNA was shown to be protective for A/J and C3H/HeDub mice, it was not protective for C3H/HeJ mice. Protective immunity could be induced in A/J and C3H/HeDub mice by various immunostimulants. Immunity in C3H/HeJ mice, however, could only be induced by Salmonella ribosomes or protein isolated from the Salmonella ribosomal fraction.

Although adneovirus type 19 (Ad19) was first described in 1955, this virus was not associated with disease until its isolation from outbreaks of conjunctivitis in 1973. A strain of Ad19 isolated from a case of conjunctivitis in Seattle in 1974 was compared with the reference strain (3911). Plaque number and size were enhanced by 30 mM MgCl2. Low pH and chloroform treatment had no effect on either strain's activity, but the two strains were sensitive to pH 8. Growth curves were characteristic of adenoviruses, but differences were seen in the amount of virus released. The ratios of particles to plaque-forming units (approximately 10,000:1) were similar for both. Both virus preparations contained high concentrations of group-specific complement-fixing antigen. Cross-reactions were seen by hemagglutination inhibition and immunoelectron microscopy between antisera to Ad8, Ad9, and Ad10 versus both strains of Ad19, but were not seen by neutralization. We would like to suggest, based on exclusive conjunctivitis association and cross-reactions, that the four cross-reacting serotypes, Ad8, Ad9, Ad10, and Ad19, represent a subgroup of adenoviruses specfically associated with conjunctivitis.

This study examined the effect of pH on the metabolism of glucose by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Radiorespirometric studies revealed that cells growing at pH 7.2 or 8.0 metabolized glucose primarily (ca. 80%) via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The remainder of the glucose was metabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway (ca. 20%). The tricarboxylic acid cycle was not active during glucose catabolism at either pH 7.2 or 8.0, and acetate accumulated in the medium. Cells growing at pH 6.0 had markedly increased pentose phosphate pathway activity (ca. 50%) and a functioning tricarboxylic acid cycle. The alteration in pathways was not due to differences in growth rate, but to the pH of the medium. Chemical fractionation of labeled cells and total hexose analyses revealed that growth pH markedly affected the composition of the gonococcus.

Various factors affecting the aggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104 were studied. When the pH of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. When the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture pH values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. Adjusting the final pH of these cultures to below 5.5 with HCl caused the cells to aggregate. Cells from unsupplemented cultures with final pH values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at pH values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. Aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees C) occurred rapidly at pH values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher pH values. Aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low pH and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. Low pH values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus.

Actinomyces viscosus T14V and Streptococcus sanguis 34 coaggregate by a mechanism which is not inhibited by 1 M NaCl, is dextran independent, requires calcium, is pH dependent with an optimum at pH 8.0 to 8.5, and appears to require the interaction of a protein or glycoprotein on A. viscosus with a carbohydrate on S. sanguis. The coaggregation is inhibited more than 80% by 0.01 M lactose, 0.02 M beta-methyl-D-galactoside, or 0.05 M D-galactose; inhibition of coaggregation was less than 10% in 0.1 M alpha-methyl-D-galactoside, melibiose, maltose, cellobiose, sucrose, and a number of monosaccharides. At very high concentrations of enzyme, protease from S. griseus destroyed the reactive site on A. viscosus but not on S. sanguis. Both were totally resistant to dextranase. Periodate (0.01 M; pH 4) inactivated both bacteria. The ability of S. sanguis to coaggregate with A. viscosus was not destroyed by phenol-water extraction at 65 degrees C for 15 min. When the bacteria were cultured under specified conditions, the coaggregation was highly reproducible. Under the same conditions, T14AV, the avirulent mutant of A. viscosus T14V, did not coaggregate with S. sanguis 34. Electron microscopic studies of coaggregates, labeled immunochemically with antibody to A. viscosus, indicated that fibrils on A. viscosus may be involved in the coaggregation.

A simple and rapid test for the detection of antisperm antibodies of the IgG class on freely swimming spermatozoa in fresh human semen is described. The test is based on the formation of motile mixed agglutinates between erythrocytes sensitized with incomplete anti-Rh-antibodies and freely swimming spermatozoa with surface antisperm antibodies, after mixing both cell types together with anti-IgG antiserum. Agglutination of the red blood cells serves as an internal control. The test can be applied on ejaculates with spermatozoa concentrations down to one million per ml, provided the motility is sufficient. The percentage of motile spermatozoa found to be coated with antisperm antibodies of the IgG class, and the extent of the coating, proved to be correlated with the agglutination titer of circulating antisperm antibodies and with the inhibition of sperm penetration into cervical mucus. The test can be used as a screening for the presence of antisperm autoantibodies in serum and semen.

Activities of 9 enzymes were determined biochemically in the endometrium. In Trial I (five women) 25 mg progesterone were injected i.m. on day 9 of the cycle; and endometrial biopsy taken 24 hours later was compared with endometrium from day 10 and day 21, taken in two untreated cycles from the same volunteers. Similarly, in Trial II (five women) 50 mg progesterone were injected on day 9, biopsy taken on day 11 and compared with days 11 and 21 from untreated cycles. The specific activites of lactate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), malate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, beta-glucuronidase, acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) were significantly higher in the secretory phase. Twenty-five milligrams progesterone (after 24 hours) caused increases of some enzymes, significant only for AP. Fifty milligrams (after 48 hours) increased significantly the activity of ICDH and ACP. Biochemical changes, especially increase of ICDH, can be used for detection of the effect of progesterone on the endometrium.

A purified fraction of human seminal plasma containing a sperm-coating antigen and two minor contaminants was used to immunize rabbits by intravenous route. An antiserum containing only the antibody against the sperm-coating antigen as examined by immunoelectrophoresis was obtained from one rabbit. The effect of this antiserum on human sperm was examined by sperm-immobilization and sperm-agglutination tests. The results revealed that the antibody against the purified sperm-coating antigen was incapable of immobilzing or agglutinating human sperm. This indicates that the purified sperm-coating antigen is unlikely to be useful as an antifertility antigen for immunologic fertility control.

An improved substrate-film technique has been developed for the assay of released proteinase from individual human spermatozoa. During the preparation of the thin gelatin membrane, it is pretreated with formaldehyde and NaOH. These agents alter the plasma membrane and the outer acrosomal membrane of the spermatozoon, facilitating the release of acrosomal enzymes. This effect is further enhanced by the addition of albumin to the incubation mixture. More than 90% of the spermatozoa in a normal ejaculate give a reaction by this method. It reaches a maximum after 4 hours of incubation and does not increase further even up to 12 hours. No difference in the reaction between washed and unwashed ejaculated spermatozoa can be found. The nature of the proteolytic activity and its possible significance in infertility are discussed.

Specimens of cervical tissue from five women each on 150 mg and 450 mg regimens of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for contraceptive purposes, were obtained through punch biopsy 15 days after injection. In another group of five women each on the same contraceptive regimens, punch biopsies of the cervix uteri were obtained 30 days after injection. These times corresponded to maximum and optimum blood levels of MPA respectively. Corresponding tissue from the same anatomical position in patients matched, where possible, for age and parity was obtained from hysterectomy specimens to serve as controls. Quantification of estrogen receptor content in the cytoplasm of these tissues was achieved through standard procedures. Analysis of data showed that MPA suppressed estrogen receptor content significantly compared to controls, but that there were no differences in this effect between the two dosages or time of biopsy.

Spontaneous isometric contractions in vitro of both isthmic and ampullary parts of the human fallopian tube were studied. The tubes were obtained during the early luteal phase of the menstrual cycle from patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and who had ingested clogestone acetate or norgestrel, either 1 or 12 hours prior to the experiment. A dose of 150 microgram dl-norgestrel given orally 12 hours preoperatively caused a significant increase in the frequency of spontaneous isometric contractions together with a significant reduction in the area under the curve for each contraction. The possible effect of this altered pattern of motility is discussed.

In studying the metabolic pathway of lactate and pyruvate in human spermatozoa from fertile and infertile subjects, pyruvate 1-C14 and lactate 1-C14 were used as substrates in a radiorespirometry system. Spermatozoa from patients with 20 +/- 2.0/10(6) spz/ml and decreased motility (group B) showed a more active decarboxylation of both pyruvate 1-C14 and lactate 1-C14 with a higher production of lactate C14, oxaloacetate, citrate, and isocitrate than those from fertile normal subjects (group A). Spermatozoa from fertile patients with normal counts but low motility (35 +/- 2.0% +++ motility) showed a similar rate of decarboxtlation of pyruvate 1-C14 but a greater rate of decarboxylation of lactate 1-C14 than those from fertile subjects. The low utilization of pyruvate by the spermatozoa from group C infertile patients, with intermediate counts and motility could be explained by a metabolic failure similar to that produced by some inhibitors of the respiratory chain. We do not have an explanation for the metabolic behavior observed in spermatozoa from group B patients, and further research on this point is desirable.

The application of kallikrein--a kinin-releasing porcine pancreatic kininogenase--exerted considerable stimulation of bull sperm motility in vitro. The kallikrein was used in two concentrations: 1 and 100 KU/ml semen. Both concentrations gave similar effect: at the 4th hour of incubation at room temperature the motility rate of spermatozoa exceeded five and four times, respectively, that of the control samples. Higher penetrating ability of bull spermatozoa in cow's estral secretion was also recorded in the experimental samples treated with kallikrein in both concentrations at the 2nd and 4th hour of incubation in comparison with the controls.

Using a retrospective case control design on 101 women with a first episode of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), it was found that 15% were wearing an intrauterine device, as compared to 7% out of a control group of 101 women matched for age, marital status, and interval since their last pregnancy termination. No statistically significant correlation between IUD usage and PID was demonstrated. A significant correlation (P less than 0.01) between previous induced abortion and subsequent PID was found. In the PID group, a significantly higher proportion of previous abdominal and pelvic operations (P less than 0.005) was found as compared to the control group, but the numbers were small. In the absence of a higher frequency of IUD wearers among PID patients as compared with matched controls, we do not believe that there is an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.

Prolactin concentration was estimated by radioimmunoassay in seminal plasma and serum of 26 oligospermic and 23 normospermic men. No significant difference was found in the mean serum prolactin concentration between normospermic and oligospermic subjects, but there was an inverse correlation between serum prolactin level and sperm count within the group of oligospermic patients. Although the mean prolactin concentration in seminal plasma of oligospermic group was somewhat lower than in the normospermic group the difference did not reach statistical significance, and no correlation was found between seminal plasma prolactin concentration and sperm count within either group.

With the increased popularity of the IUD as a contraceptive method, there is a rise in the cases of occult IUDs as a result of the disappearance of the threads from the vagina. Our experience has shown that in the cases where the marker is missing, but the IUD is in the uterine cavity, it can be easily removed by using the Novak curette. This procedure spares the patients general anesthesia, D & C, and unnecessary hospitalization with its expenses.

The subcutaneous implantation of estradiol pellets was found to be a simple and effective contraceptive method with good patient acceptance and minimal untoward effects. The pellets (25 mg each) were implanted through a Kearn's trocar into the abdominal wall, 2.5 to 5 cm above and parallel to Poupart's ligament. The regimen began with four pellets, and the dose was maintained or decreased by one pellet every 6 months (four, three, two, one). A potent progestogen was utilized monthly for induction of withdrawal bleeding. Altogether, 236 patients were followed for a total of 1,060 courses in 6,360 cycles (489,02 woman-years). Two pregnancies occurred during therapy. Pearl's index was 0.37. No significant alterations occurred in body weight and blood pressure. Glucose tolerance test, standard blood profiles, and Papanicolaou smears were normal during therapy. No cases of thrombophlebitis, blurred vision, headaches, gastric symptoms, or amenorrhea-galactorrhea were observed. The suppression of ovulation was confirmed by endometrial biopsies, basal body temperature, and serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, and progesterone in a selected group of patients.

The activity of uterine ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was measured during the 24 hours after systemic induction of decidualization. Following a latent period of 2.5 hours, activity rose and reached a peak of 5.6 +/- 1.1 fold at 5 hours after induction. The activity then declined and a second, lower peak was seen at 21 hours. The increase in ODC activity was suppressed by treatment with cycloheximide (50 mg/kg) and dactinomycin, 500 microgram/rat, confirming that the enzyme response reflects protein synthesis. The increase and the base-line level of ODC activity were suppressed by ergocornine pretreatment (1 mg/rat) which disturbs the endocrine balance of pseudopregnancy. It was concluded that the growth and differentiation of decidual tissue began 2.5 hours after application of the induction stimulus.

By means of selective solubilization methods and slab gel electrophoresis, reproducible patterns of 19, 37, and 56 protein bands were found to be associated with nuclear, "flagellar," and total human spermatozoa, respectively. Forty protein bands were found between the molecular weight of 12,400 to 160,000 daltons. Twelve bands were associated with values lower than 12,400 daltons. The nuclear major bands were located in a low molecular weight zone, while "flagellar" ones were located in a high molecular weight zone. None of these bands represents degradation products since a) in the solubilized samples neither acrosin, chymotrypsin, nor trypsin activities were present, b) in the presence of two protease inhibitors the same electrophoretic patterns were observed, and c) labelled globins added during sample manipulation were quantitatively recovered without degradation.

Uterine anomalies are due either to primary congenital malformations, or to secondary traumatic lesions of the intrauterine cavity as well as to pathology of the endometrium. The latter two etiologic factors create difficulties in the correct diagnosis of a congenital malformation and despite the convincing hysterosalpingographic findings a false diagnosis of a congenital malformation and despite the convincing hysterosalpingographic findings a false diagnosis is frequent. On the other hand the various degrees of uterine anomalies cannot always convince the gynecologist to undertake a plastic operation where the results for future fertility are doubtful. In our experience the extensive beneficial use of a variety of selected IUDs for the correction of intrauterine lesions also resulted in the correction of the size and shape of the uteri, previously diagnosed as malformed. The preliminary results of treatment in 110 cases of uterine anomalies after the application of a selected IUD combined with the administration of high doses of gestagens, showed an overall satisfactory improvement or complete reconstruction to a normal uterus in 86 (78%) of the cases. Higher fertility rate, better pregnancy outcome, correct diagnosis of the existing malformation, and safer decisions for further correction have also been attributed to the beneficial effects of the above treatment.

Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated the specific synthesis of a soluble protein (A) in the rat endometrium on day L4 of pseudopregnancy 1 h after the decidual induction; the A protein synthesis being higher in the antimesometrial region (AMR) than in the mesometrial one. We have now examined in the AMR of rat endometria on day L4 of pseudopregnancy: 1) the effect of cycloheximide (500 microgram, i.p. 30 min before decidual induction) on the biosynthesis of the A protein, and 2) the effect of actinomycin D (Act. D) (5 microgram/uterine horn 60 min before the decidual stimulation) on the induction of A protein synthesis. The synthesis of the A protein was determined by acrylamide gel electrophoresis of endometrial soluble proteins after double-labeling incorporation of amino acids. Results showed that: 1) the cycloheximide inhibited the synthesis of the A protein which indicates a de novo protein synthesis; 2) the Act. D inhibited the A synthesis suggesting that synthesis of an Act. D-sensitive product is one of the earliest macromolecular synthetic events after decidual induction.

Release rates of testosterone, estrone, and estradiol placed in chambers made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDS) tubing (Dow Corning "Silastic," 3.35 mm ID x 4.65 mm OD) were studied in 14 freemartin cattle with minimal or non-detectable endogenous hormone secretion, and in 0.9% saline:methanol (1:1) baths shaken at 38 degree C. Eighty-seven implants, varying in length from 2 to 10 cm, were placed in 14 animals for 27 to 235 days. The average release rates +/- standard errors, in microgram/cm/day, were testosterone, 55.9 +/- 2.4, estrone, 12.6 +/- 1.8, and estradiol, 11.1 +/- 1.1. A relatively constant release rate was found over the period of time studied and sufficient steroid remained for potential release over periods exceeding 1 year. The dose of hormone delivered was sufficient to increase mounting activity in testosterone-treated animals and estrual activity in those receiving estrogens. Corresponding release rates in vitro for four 10-cm implants containing either testosterone, estrone, or estradiol were 94.3 +/- 1.9, 15.5 +/- 0.7, and 12.7 +/- 0.6 microgram/cm/day, respectively. The general magnitude of release rate in animals could be predicted from laboratory tests.

An improved IUD design has been developed, called the Combined Multiload Copper IUD, whose properties combine an easy insertion procedure with a high resistance to expulsion.  The new design features an improved polyethylene skeleton which decreases the need to extend the uterine cavity and also decreases the medical removal rate.  The Combined Multiload Copper IUD (MLCu) is available with 250 mm copper or 375 mm copper wiring around the vertical stem.  18 months of multicenter comparative testing among the MLCu device, the Lippes D, and 2 older-model copper T devices showed the MLCu device to have much lower expulsion and much higher continuation rates without sacrificing in pregnancy-prevention performance.  Results with the MLCu375 show even lower pregnancy rates with no more medical removals or expulsions than with the MLCu250.  The added advantage of the MLCu375 is that there is no need for replacement before 5 years.  Clinical tests of postplacental insertion of the MLCu250 were carried out on 78 women in Ghent, Belgium, with promising results.  Multicenter trials are continuing.

The present techniques for sterilization of women consist of different methods to block the passage through the oviducts. The disadvantage of all techniques is that the possiblity of restoring fertility is very limited. The aim of the present study is to demonstrate a method of sterilization which is reversible.

The temporal and qualitative aspects of the conceptual process of a small number of pregnancies achieved by donor insemination have been analysed to understand the semen values required and the optimal insemination timing and route.

LH-RH and three particular ("super") analogues were evaluated for agonistic (ovulation-induction and short-term uterotrophic properties) and  postcoital contraceptive activity in rodents. Additionally, LH-RH and/or a representative analogue (D-Ala6-des Gly10-Pro9-LH-RH ethylamide) were tested for postcoital contraceptive/vaginal smear/return to fertility effects, precoital contraceptive activity, and effects on puberty in the immature female. All compounds induced ovulation and uterotrophic effects and terminated pregnancy when administered either pre- or post-implantation. LH-RH and the representative analogue, while terminating pregnancy postcoitally, produced an associated break in the characteristic leucocytic vaginal smear of pregnancy to one of cornification by day 12; at this time mating and insemination were reestablished and all rats carried to normal term. Precoitally, LH-RH administered to nembutalized (but not to unblocked) rats produced a 50% reduction in the pregnancy rate and a 38% decrease in the number of viable pups delivered. In immature rats, the representative analogue delayed puberty (i.e. vaginal canalization) and retarded the growth of the ovaries, uteri, and anterior pituitary gland. The collective data strongly support the concept that LH-RH and agonistic derivatives, in spite of their putative pro-fertility classification, are characteristically antifertility by nature. Since the latter effect appears to be the paradoxically dominant one, it is suggested that LH-RH agonism is synonymous with contraception. Furthermore, such peptides may represent a new potential approach to fertility control.

Wedge resection (WR) was performed in 12 women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), and Incision was done in 4 PCOD patients without any resection of ovarian tissue. Serum LH, FSH, estradiol-17beta (E2), progesterone, and urinary 17 ketosteroid (17KS) were measured serially before and after surgery. Neither WR nor Incision had any effect on FSH levels. Serum LH levels which had been hypergonadotropic preoperatively, became markedly lower 7--14 days after surgery in 12 wedge-resected and 2 incised patients. Within 7 days after WR there was a significant fall of E2 and a decrease of 17KS. In addition to those hormonal changes observed after WR, BBT charts turned out to be diphasic after the oral administration of dydrogesterone (Duphaston) in 12 out of 17 PCOD patients. The present data suggest that the reduction of the serum LH, induced by an interaction between the ovarian steroidogenesis and the suprapituitary mechanisms, might be involved in the occurrence of ovulation after WR in PCOD patients.

Obesity results when the ingestion of energy exceeds its utilization, leading to an excessive expansion of the adipose tissue mass. Current pharmacological therapy for the obese patient focuses primarily on reducing energy intake. Anorectic agents reduce food consumption by modifying central systems in the brain which are involved in appetite regulation. These agents are reviewed in terms of mechanism of action, and clinical safety and efficacy in suppressing appetite and promoting weight loss. Newer anorectic agents which are being evaluated currently in clinical and animal studies are described. Clinical assessments of therapeutic regimens utilizing the thyroid hormones and human chorionic gonadotropin are evaluated. Finally, an overview of novel pharmacological approaches to the treatment of obesity is presented.

The antimicrobial activity of urine collected from adult male paraplegics ingesting methenamine mandelate (MM) was evaluated. The in vitro bacterial growth in urine from these patients was inhibited when the free formaldehyde (HCHO) concentration was 10 to 22 microgram per ml. When the HCHO concentration was in the region of 28 microgram per ml or greater, bactericidal effect became apparent. Urine containing 1323 microgram of MM per ml with a pH of 5.9 when freshly voided had sufficient HCHO to be bacteriostatic. Urine containing at least 1740 microgram of MM per ml with a pH of 5.1 or less when freshly voided was bactericidal. The latter concentration of MM in urine was usually achieved when the patient ingested 4 g of MM per day in divided doses and the intake of fluid was not excessive. Under some circumstances an individual receiving MM without an additional acidifying agent may produce urine with a pH low enough to release sufficient HCHO to exert a useful antibacterial effect. However, supplementary acidification with ammonium chloride produced marked lowering of the urinary pH in all patients receiving MM, resulting in bactericidal levels of HCHO.

We have previusly provided physiologic and histochemical data implicating the bladder surface mucin layer as an important new antibacterial defense mechanism. This mucin or its contents seems to act as an "antiadherence factor", inhibiting bacterial adherence to the bladder mucosa and thereby facilitating the removal of bacteria by the voiding process. The present study was designed to investigate three mechanisms by which the mucin might repel bacterial attachment. Our data suggest that neither IgA nor a chelating agent are anti-adherence factors. We did find, however, that pH had a significant effect on the adherence of bacteria to mucosal cells stripped of their mucin layer. This result suggest that electrochemical charge is important in bacterial adherence. We beleive that the mucin layer both provides an electrochemical coat on the bladder surface that is a poor substrate for bacterial adherence and blocks the receptor sites of the transitional cells to which the microbes might adhere.

A case of a newborn infant with clinical and angiocardiographic signs of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is presented. The baby died after a short therapy with beta-blockers. Light- and electron-microscopic investigations showed severe disorganization of muscular cellular arrangement and disturbances of intracellular structures of the interventricular septum. HOCM is a genetically determined disease which can present clinically in the newborn period and may simulate congenital cardiac malformations.

Coenzyme fluorescence spectra of single living cells are due to free pyridine nucleotides (folded configuration), bound pyridine nucleotides (unfolded configuration) and a third component, possibly a mixture or flavins. Such spectra can be used to recognize possible differences in coenzyme composition between cell lines or changes of metabolic pathways due to chemicals acting at levels below or above cytotoxicity, by high resolution spectrofluorometry. A study of spectra recorded from cultured Ehrlich ascites (EL2), and Harding Passey melanoma cells (HPM-67 and HPM-73 line) grown under comparable conditions, shows that free NAD(P)H predominates in HPM-67 and EL2, while this coenzyme is bound in HPM-73. The free/bound ratio may be profoundly modifed by chemicals, e.g. in the HPM-73 increase of free and decrease of bound NAD(P)H occurred upon treatment with 10(-6) oligomycin. When atebrine at levels (10(-6) M) below cytotoxicity was added, there was a decrease of the free NAD(P)H spectrum possibly through energy transfer from NAD(P)H to atebrine. Consideration of long range energy transfer i.e., excitation of atebrine by fluorescence of NAD(P)H vs. short range transfer of excitation energy from free NAD(P)H to atebrine, favors the latter mechanism. A transient (reversible) increase in atebrine fluorescence is seen following intracellular microinjection of substrate (e.g. glucose-6-P) leading to an increase in free NAD(P)H. At cytotoxic levels of atebrine (e.g 2 x 10(-5) M) an irreversible increase of atebrine fluorescence is seen. The microspectrofluorometric technique appears therefore well suited to study physiological processes at the level of intracellular coenzymes, as well as possible processes of intermolecular energy transfer in the microenvironment.

Arterial blood pH (pHa) was continuously monitored in decerebrate or pentobarbital-anesthetized cats with a rapidly responding hydrogen ion sensor inserted into the aorta. Alveolar carbon dioxide partial pressure and pHa were controlled independently during infusions of 1 N NaHCO3 or 0.5 N HCl into the inferior vena cava. Shifts in pHa up to 0.3 unit were effected isocapnically within 2.5-20 s over a working pHa range of 6.9-7.7. Before carotid sinus neurotomy, average onset latency of the tidal volume (VT) response to acid and alkaline pHa shifts was less than 5 S and the average VT response half time was less than 8.5 s regardless of whether the vagus nerves had been interrupted. After carotid sinus neurotomy, the deltaVT onset latency was approximately doubled, whereas the response half time was prolonged about eightfold on the average. Subsequent vagotomy tended further to increase the responding time lag. Nevertheless, the minimum response latency after peripheral chemodenervation was less than the deltapHa forcing rise time. It is concluded that the central chemoreceptors promptly sense pH change in the arterial blood and that neural processes adjust the time course of the respiratory response through the VT controller.

A stopped-flow pH electrode apparatus was used to investigate the mechanisms underlying slow changes in plasma pH (pHO) after blood leaves the pulmonary capillaries in carbonic anhydrase-inhibited animals. After acetazolamide was administered to an anesthetized dog or cat, arterial blood was withdrawn through the electrode apparatus into a syringe. Syringe movement was then suddenly stopped. Temperature and pHO of the blood in the electrode chamber were monitored both before and after blood withdrawal ceased. After stopping flow, pHO of the blood in the electrode chamber a) rose 0.02 after a dose of about 1 mg/kg acetazolamide; b) did not change after a dose of about 2 mg/kg acetazolamide; and c) fell 0.10 after a dose greater than about 5 mg/kg acetazolamide. With reasonable red cell and plasma carbonic anhydrase activities assumed for each dose level of acetazolamide, a computer model of the reaction and transport processes occurring in blood after gas exchange in the lung yielded predicted time courses of pHo that were in good agreement with the experimental results. The observed slow pHo changes are largely a result of disequilibrium of [H+] between red blood cells and plasma as blood leaves the pulmonary capillaries.

The direct and indirect actions on left ventricular dynamics of contrast material (sodium meglumine diatrizoate) currently used for coronary arteriography, modified ionic material (sodium meglumine calcium metrizoate) and non-ionic material (metrizamide) were assessed in conscious and anesthetized dogs. In both anesthetized and conscious animals, the diatrizoate compound caused an early (3--10 sec after injection) decrease in peak dp/dt and dp/dt/LVP40, followed by late (10--20 sec after injection) increases in these variables. The predominant early and later effects of the calcium metrizoate compound were increases in parameters of LV contractile state. Metrizamide produced no significant early alterations, but later induced a small increase in these variables. The positive inotropic actions of each of the contrast materials were attenuated by beta adrenergic blockade. The early effects of the contrast materials were similar in the presence of segmental ischemia. The late positive inotropic effects in response to the diatrizoate compound and metrizamide were not observed in the ischemic state, while the positive inotropic response induced by the calcium metrizoate compound was significantly reduced. Thus intracoronary administration of sodium meglumine diatrizoate produced direct myocardial depression, followed by adrenergically mediated myocardial stimulation. Calcium metrizoate caused prominent direct and adrenergically mediated augmentation in contractile state. Metrizamide induced the least alteration in LV contractile state.

The membrane-bound ATP synthetase complex of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum showed maximum activity for ATP hydrolysis at pH 8, at temperatures between 65 and 70 degrees C, and at an ATP-Mg2+ ratio of 0.5. Anaerobic conditions were not prerequisite for enzyme activity. The enzyme showed a Km value for ATP of 2 mM, and activity was Mg2+ dependent; Mn2+, Co2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ could replace Mg2+ to some extent. Other nucleoside triphosphates could be hydrolyzed. N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibited ATP hydrolysis. A proton-motive force, artificially imposed by a pH shift or valinomycin, resulted in ATP synthesis in whole cells. The ATP synthetase complex of the thermophilic methanogenic bacterium is similar to those described in aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

Trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes, added together with transforming DNA or during cell-DNA contact to competent cultures of several streptococcal strains, enchanced (10 to 600%) the yield of genetic transformation (stimulation). With few exceptions, the level of stimulation was high (over 100%) when competence was low (below 2%). Stimulation was caused by the action of an enzyme on competent cells and not on any other component of transformation mixture. The phenomenon occurred when the enzyme was added to the culture not earlier than 7 min before and not later than 5 min after the period of cell-DNA contact. The presence of trypsin during cell-DNA contact caused: (i) the alterations at cell surface, demonstrated by electron microscopy, increased release of 3H-amino acid-labeled material, and higher cell susceptibility to autolysis; (ii) the increase of both total and irreversible binding of DNA by the cells; and (iii) the decrease of early nucleolytic degradation of DNA by cells. These and other data point to the importance of a delicate balance of recipient cell's surface nuclease activities in the effectiveness of transformation process. It is also possible that trypsin eliminates an unknown cellular factor which obstructs DNA-cell receptors interaction.

Trichosporon cutaneum degraded 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid to acetoacetic and malic acids. 3.4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, an intermediate in the reaction sequence, underwent hydroxylation before the benzene ring was cleaved.

The mechanism by which iron uptake is facilitated by the siderophore rhodotorulic acid (RA) in the yeast Rhodotorula pilimanae was investigated with radioactively labeled Fe and RA and kinetically inert, chromic-substituted RA complexes. The weight of the evidence supports a model in which RA mediates iron transport to the cell but does not actually transport iron into the cell. It is proposed that RA exchanges the ferric ion at the cell surface with a membrane-bound chelating agent that completes the active transport of iron into the cell. Uptake of 55Fe in ferric rhodotorulate was much more rapid than uptake of RA itself. Two exchange-inert chromic complexes of RA showed no uptake.

The cytosine liponucleotides CDP-diglyceride and dCDP-diglyceride are key intermediates in phospholipid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli (C. R. H. Raetz and E. P. Kennedy, J. Biol. Chem. 248:1098--1105, 1973). The enzyme responsible for their synthesis, CTP:phosphatidic acid cytidylytransferase, was solubilized from the cell envelope by a differential extraction procedure involving the detergent digitonin and was purified about 70-fold (relative to cell-free extracts) in the presence of detergent. In studies of the heat stability of the enzyme, activity decayed slowly at 63 degrees C. Initial velocity kinetic experiments suggested a sequential, rather than ping-pong, reaction mechanism; isotopic exchange reaction studies supported this conclusion and indicated that inorganic pyrophosphate is released before CDP-diglyceride in the reaction sequence. The enzyme utilized both CTP and dCTP as nucleotide substrate for the synthesis of CDP-diglyceride and dCDP-diglyceride, respectively. No distinction was observed between CTP and dCTP utilization in any of the purification, heat stability, and reaction mechanism studies. In addition, CTP and dCTP were competitive substrates for the partially purified enzyme. It therefore appears that a single enzyme catalyzes synthesis of both CDP-diglyceride and dCDP-diglyceride in E. coli. The enzyme also catalyzes a pyrophosphorolysis of CDP-diglyceride, i.e., the reverse of its physiologically important catalysis.

The cellular autolytic reaction system in Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 was analyzed for relative increases in reaction rates with increasing temperature by determination of Arrhenius activation energies (E). The systems examined were: (i) an isolated wall-enzyme complex in 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.9; (ii) exponential-phase cells suspended in 0.01 or o.3 M sodium phosphate pH 6.8, or in 0.04 M ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, (iii) growing cultures deprived of glucose or lysine; and (iv) cultures treated in growth media with the nonionic detergent, Triton X-100. For detergent-treated cells, E values were between 23.9 and 27.4 kcal/mol (ca. 100.1 to 174.7 kJ/mol) at concentrations of Triton X-100 between about 0.03 and 0.072 mg/ml. E values dropped sharply to 11.5 to 13.0 kcal/m-l (ca. 48.2 to 54.4 kJ/mol) at Triton X-100 concentrations of 0.12 mg/ml or higher. For the remaining systems, E values ranged from 16 to 20 kcal/mol (ca. 67.0 to 83.7 kJ/mol) (wall lysis, cellular autolysis in 0.01 M sodium phosphate or in 0.04 M ammonium acetate, and autolysis of glucose-starved cells) to 31 to 38 kcal/mol (ca 129.8 to 159.1 kJ/mol) (cellular autolysis in 0.3 M sodium phosphate or autolysis of lysine-starved cells). High concentrations of Triton X-100 appear to lower the E values below the 16 to 20 kcal/mol observed for the autolysis of isolated walls. This effect may be related to disruption by the detergent of a hydrophobic complex regulating cellular autolysis in vivo.

A two-step purification of pneumococcal eclipse complex is described, which uses sucrose gradient sedimentation followed by agarose gel permeation chromatography. Purified complex contains, in addition to donor DNA single strands, macromolecular material that can be labeled with methionine or leucine during development of competence. This material co-chromatographed with eclipse complex DNA on hydroxylapatite, was dissociated from the DNA by sodium dodecyl sulfate, and was completely digested by Pronase. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-released material eluted as a single peak in sodium dodecyl sulfate chromatography. These properties were consistent with the noncovalent association with eclipse complex of a protein or class of proteins with a narrow range of polypeptide sizes. Evidence for the specific association of this protein with transforming DNA is eclipse was also obtained from parallel purification from 35S-labeled nontransformed cells; the amount of methionine label in the corresponding fractions in such cells was only 5% of that in transformed cells.

To determine whether Salmonella typhimurium has a nitrogen control response, we have examined the regulation of nitrogen utilization in two mutants with fivefold and threefold elevations in their glutamine synthetase activities. The mutants do not require glutamine for growth on glucose--ammonia medium but do have altered growth on other nitrogen sources. They grow better than an isogenic control on media containing arginine or asparate, but more slowly with proline or alanine as nitrogen sources. This unusual growth pattern is not due to altered regulation of the ammonia assimilatory enzymes, glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate synthase, or to changes in the enzymes for aspartate degradation. However, transport for several amino acids may be affected. Measurement of amino acid uptake show that the mutants with high glutamine synthetase levels have increased rates for glutamine, arginine, aspartate, and lysine, but a decreased rate for proline. The relationship between glutamine synthetase levels and uptake  was examined in two mutants with reduced, rather than increased, glutamine synthetase production. The uptake rates for glutamine and lysine were lower in these two glutamine auxotrophs than in the Gln+ controls. These results show a correlation between the glutamine synthetase levels and the uptake rates for several amino acids. In addition, the pleiotropic growth of the mutants with elevated glutamine synthetase activities suggests that a nitrogen control response exists for S. typhimurium and that it can be altered by mutations affecting glutamine synthetase regulation.

m-Aminobenzeneboronic acid at levels of 0.2 mM in nutrient broth medium selectively inhibited sporulation without appreciably altering vegetative growth. Significant inhibitory effects were seen even when it was added as late as 6 h after the end of logarithmic growth. The pH changes associated with growth and sporulation of Bacillus subtilis in nutrient broth were not significantly altered by the inhibitor. When it was present in cultures of actively growing cells, its inhibitory effect could not be reversed by simple dilution. The compound caused  extensive clumping, of cells, which appeared not to be related to the ability of boronates to esterify to diols.

Two enzymes have been partially purified from extracts of Escherchia coli B which together catalyze the conversion of the product of the action of GTP cyclohydrolase II, 2,5-diamino-6-oxy-4-(5'-phosphoribosylamine)pyrimidine, to 5-amino-2,6-dioxy-4-(5'-phosphoribitylamine)pyrimidine. These two compounds are currently thought to be intermediates in the biosynthesis of riboflavin. The enzymatic conversion occurs in two steps. The product of the action of GTP cyclohydrolase II first undergoes hydrolytic deamination at carbon 2 of the ring, followed by reduction of the ribosylamino group to a ribitylamino group. The enzyme which catalyzes the first step, herein called the "deaminase," has been purified 200-fold. The activity was assayed by detecting the conversion of the product of the reaction catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase II to a compound which reacts with butanedione to form 6,7-dimethyllumazine. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 80,000 and a pH optimum of 9.1. The dephosphorylated form of the substrate is not deaminated in the presence of the enzyme. The assay for the enzyme which catalyzes the second step, referred to here as the "reductase," involves the detection of the conversion of the product of the deaminase-catalyzed reaction to a compound which, after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, reacts with butanedione to form 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. The reductase has a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 and a pH optimum of 7.5. Like the deaminase, the reductase does not act on the dephosphorylated form of its substrate. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is required as a cofactor; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide can be used about 30% as well as the phosphate form. The activity of neither enzyme is inhibited by riboflavin, FMN, or flavine adenine dinucleotide.

The pathway of uridylic acid biosynthesis established by Leiberman, Kornberg, and Simms has been shown to be operative in the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis. The only enzyme of uridylic acid biosynthesis found to be lacking in two uracil-requiring strains of A. variabilis was aspartate transcarbamylase, the first enzyme in the pathway of de novo biosynthesis of uridvlic acid. Neither uracil-limited growth of a uracil-requiring mutant nor growth of the wild type in high concentrations of uracil resulted in substantial changes in the specific activities of enzymes of uridylic acid biosynthesis. It is therefore concluded that A. variabilis does not regulate all enzymes of this pathway by means of repression. However, control of the flow of intermediates through this pathway is possible by feedback inhibition of aspartate transcarbamylase by a variety of nucleotides.

An outer membrane phospholipase A active against phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine was characterized from Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N.

Tardive dyskinesia, a delayed side effect of neuroleptic drugs, requires early recognition and a systematic treatment plan. An outline is presented which offers guidelines for management strategies and drug treatments, along with a summary of recent developments.

During acute and chronic administrations of lithium, 25 patients were studied to determine the effect of other psychotropic drugs on the plasma-saliva lithium concentration correlations. Changes, even discontinuation, in either tricyclic antidepressants or neuroleptics did not affect the plasma-saliva ratio which had an overall correlation coefficient of r = 0.79 (p less than 0.01). The relationship using linear regression analysis was described by the equation, y = 2.27x--0.45. Individual patients' plasma-salivary relations were described by this equation in 87% of cases. The study extends the usefulness of these determinations to include patients on lithium and neuroleptics or tricyclic antidepressants.

The metabolic disposition of lorazepam (Wy-4036) in man, dog, cat, rat and miniature swine is compared. Except in the cat, absorption of lorazepam is rapid in these species. Absorption in humans is nearly complete. Lorazepam glucuronide is the major metabolite in all species except the rat in which a dihydrodiol derivative is the main product of lorazepam biotransformation. Lorazepam glucuronide, which has no demonstrable CNS activity, is also present in the plasma of all species investigated. The concentrations of lorazepam in rat brain correlate well with those in plasma but are about three times higher. The urinary route of excretion predominates in man, dog and miniature swine while in the rat the bulk of the drug-related material is eliminated with the feces as a consequence of biliary excretion.

The clinical pharmacokinetics of lorazepam, a 3-hydroxy, 1,4-benzodiazepine, indicate that it is rapidly and readily absorbed, reaching peak concentrations in the blood proportional to the dose approximately 2 hours after oral administration. Blood levels decline thereafter, with an elimination half-life of about 12 hrs. Conjugation with glucuronic acid to form inactive lorazepam glucuronide is the major metabolic pathway. Seventy (70) to 75% of the administered dose is excreted as the glucuronide conjugate in the urine. On multiple-dose regimens, steady state blood levels directly proportional to the daily dose occur within 2--3 days and are maintained after several months of continuous treatment. The active drug and the glucuronide conjugate are completely eliminated from the blood within 1 week following the last dose.

In a four-week double-blind study of 68 adult outpatients, lorazepam a new benzodiazepine, administered at an average total daily dosage level of 3.1 mg on a b.i.d. regimen, was clearly superior to placebo in the treatment of neurotic anxiety and its related symptoms. The lorazepam-treated group showed significantly greater improvement than the placebo-treated group (both clinically and statistically), as evidenced by the greater changes on the physician-rated Global Scale as well as by the greater changes in almost all categories on the physician-rated Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the patient-rated Lipman-Rickels 35-Item Self-Rating Scale. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or laboratory values and only one side effect, urinary retention (resolved without discontinuing the drug), was reported.

Lorazepam reduced conflict behavior in rats and monkeys, inhibited pentylenetetrazol- and electroshock-induced convulsions, suppressed footshock-induced fighting behavior, and prevented morphine-induced stimulation in mice at lower doses than other benzodiazepines tested. This behavioral profile suggests that lorazepam will be an active anti-anxiety agent in man at low doses.

Twelve studies were undertaken under a common four-week protocol to investigate the efficacy of lorazepam compared with placebo in reducing the severity of moderate to severe anxiety in 264 patients also having significant depressive symptomatology. Analysis of the results indicated that lorazepam gave generally better anxiety relief than placebo; in the majority of comparisons the differences were substantial enough to be both statistically and clinically significant. No data were obtained evidencing significant toxicity in either treatment group.

Lorazepam was administered to 38 patients with moderate to severe anxiety associated with cardiovascular symptomatology. A comparable group of patients on placebo (35) served as controls in this 4-week study. Average dosage was 3 mg/day given as 2 mg in the evening and 1 mg in the morning. The Global response, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores, and 35-Item Self-Rating Scale scores showed lorazepam to be significantly more effective in relieving anxiety than placebo, both clinically and statistically. Adverse reactions were transient and tolerable, and were reported in only 2 patients on lorazepam.

Sixty-two adults with a current diagnosis of significant hypertension and accompanying moderate to severe anxiety were medicated with lorazepam or with placebo for a period of 4 weeks. The patients were assessed by 7 cardiologists under double-blind conditions and the results pooled. Symptoms of anxiety were quantified using a Global Physician Rating, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and a Patient Self-Rating Scale. The symptoms of anxiety associated with hypertension were significantly relieved by lorazepam in comparison to placebo. Most lorazepam patients were controlled with 3 mg/day; except for 1 patient, side effects were mild and transient.

The effectiveness of lorazepam was assessed under double-blind conditions in 70 ambulant patients suffering from anxiety associated with gastrointestinal symptomatology. In this 4-week study, the usual daily dose of lorazepam, 3.0 mg given in a b.i.d. regimen, produced a greater decrease in symptoms associated with anxiety than placebo at almost all evaluation periods, as indicated by Kruskal-Wallis analyses of Global, Hamilton, and 35-Item ratings--a decrease which was clinically and statistically significant. In addition, lorazepam was well accepted and well tolerated by the majority of patients and was compatible with concomitant medications. Side effects were infrequent and usually controlled by dosage adjustment.

Using a common protocol, 9 gastroenterologists assessed the comparative antianxiety efficacy of lorazepam and placebo under double-blind conditions in 48 patients with moderate to severe anxiety associated with chronic enteritis and ulcerative colitis. The initial dose of lorazepam was 3 mg per day given b.i.d., 2 mg h.s. and 1 mg a.m.; the duration of treatment was 4 weeks. The physician-rated Global and Hamilton and patient-rated 35-Item Scales were used. Efficacy was analyzed from the results of the pooled patient data. By all 3 rating scales and at virtually all times of assessment, lorazepam was associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in symptoms related to anxiety associated with chronic enteritis and ulcerative colitis than was placebo. Side effects in general were infrequent. (J Clin Psychiatry 39:[No. 10--2] 53--57, 1978).

It is known that the coupling factor purified from the acetone powder of chromatophores from Rhodospirillum rubrum shows ATPase activity in the presence of Ca(2)+, but not in the presence of Mg(2)+ or Mn(2)+. The present study deals with conditions, under which the Ca(2)+-ATPase activity is reversibly converted into Mg(2)+- and Mn(2)+-ATPase activites with the purified coupling factor. 1. Of the pH indicators tested, 6 kinds coverted the Ca(2)+-ATPase activity into Mg(2)+- and Mn(2)+-ATPase activities in the order, ethyl orange greater than tropaeolin 000 greater than or equal to metanil yellow greater than tropaeolin 00 greater than ethyl red greater than or equal to bromthymol blue. 2. Of the detergents tested, those other than Triton X-100 and Brij 58 caused the conversion described above; dodecylsulfonate was most effective, whereas dodecylpyridinium chloride was moderately effective. 3. 2,4-Dinitrophenol stimulated approximately two-fold the Ca(2)+-ATPase activity, but not the Mg(2)+- or Mn(2)+-ATPase activity at all. However, in the presence of dodecylpyridinium chloride, the pH indicator remarkably stimulated the Mg(2)+- and Mn(2)+-ATPase activities, accompanied with a partial inhibition of the Ca(2)+-ATPase activity. Methyl red and ethyl red showed similar effects. 4. All the nucleoside triphosphates tested can serve as the substrate. ATP was most effective for the Ca(2)+-ATPase activity, whereas dATP was most effective for the Mg(2)+- and Mn(2)+-ATPase activities induced by ethyl orange. 5. In the presence of ethyl orange, the ATPase activity was induced by various divalent cations in the following order of effectiveness, Mg(2)+ greater than Zn(2)+ greater than CO(2)+ greater than Mn(2)+ greater than Ni(2)+. 6. The mechanism of the reversible conversion from the Ca(2)+-ATPase activity to the Mg(2)+- and Mn(2)+-ATPase activities by pH indicators and detergents is discussed.

Exposure of rat sympathetic ganglia to 3 microgram/ml of 2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF) resulted in a 100% increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity within 48 h. Pulselabeling of proteins with [3H]leucine, followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to tyrosine hydorxylase and isolation of the precipitated enzyme by gel electrophoresis, demonstrated that the increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity was due to enhanced de novo synthesis. The incorporation of [3H]leucine into tyrosine hydroxylase was increased by 150% compared to a 17% increase in total protein synthesis, which was not statistically significant. The fact that the half-life of pulse-labeled tyrosine hydroxylase was the same for NGF-treated and control organ cultures of superior cervical ganglia excludes the possibility that enhanced tyrosine hydroxylase labeling by NGF is due to decreased degradation. We conclude that, without modulatory factors which play a role in vivo, NGF can enhance the synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase in sympathetic ganglia in vitro, provided organ culture conditions which permit optimal survival of adrenergic neurons are selected.

The effect of pH on the properties of the partial reactions of arginyl-tRNA synthetase of E. coli has been investigated. V max of pyrophosphorolysis of arginyl adenylate has a pH optimum at pH 6.1, whereas V max of the transfer of arginine to tRNA has a pH optimum of 8.2. These values correlate with the pH optima of the ATP:PPi exchange and the overall esterification reaction, respectively. Only the pyrophosphorolysis reaction requires a divalent cation; transfer proceeds in the presence of EDTA. Inorganic pyrophosphate inhibits the transfer reaction to an extent independent of the concentration of tRNA; the maximum inhibition is a function of pH, corresponding to the relative rate of pyrophosphorolysis of the common intermediate compared with the rate of transfer. These results show that different groups on the enzyme participate in the rate-limiting steps of the two partial reactions and that these partial reactions have properties consistent with their participation in the overall esterification of arginine with tRNA.

The effects of citrate and cyclic AMP on the rate and degree of phosphorylation and inactivation of rat liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase were examined. High citrate concentrations (10 to 20 mM), which are generally used to stabilize and activate the enzyme, inhibit phosphorylation and inactivation of carboxylase. At lower concentrations of citrate, the rate and degree of phosphorylation are increased. Furthermore, phosphorylation and enzyme inactivation are affected by cyclic AMP under these conditions. At high citrate concentrations, cyclic AMP has little or no effect on inactivation and phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Phosphorlation and inactivation of carboxylase is accompanied by depolymerization of the polymeric form of the enzyme into intermediate and protomeric forms. Depolymerization of carboxylase requires the transfer of the gamma-phosphate group from ATP to carboxylase. Inactivation occurs in the absence of CO2, which indicates that phosphorylation of the enzyme is the cause of inactivation and depolymerization, i.e. carboxylation of the enzyme is not responsible for inactivation of the enzyme.

If acetyl-CoA carboxylase in epididymal fat tissue is subject to control by convalent modification as in the case of the liver enzyme, catalytically different forms of carboxylase should exist, independent of polymerization. By treating epididymal fat tissue in culture with epinephrine, we have demonstrated catalytically less active forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The catalytically less active forms of the enzyme reacted to antibody with the same efficiency as the active form of carboxylase. However, the less active enzyme formed by epinephrine treatment of tissues has a sedimentation constant of 30 to 35 S, whereas that of the enzyme from control tissue is 45 S. Incubation of the less active forms of the carboxylase with 10 mM citrate and up to 10 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin activated the enzyme without any change in the sedimentation constant. Therefore, the less active forms of the carboxylase formed as a result of epinephrine treatment are not due to the depolymerization of polymeric forms (45 S) to the protomeric forms (17 to 20 S), but to the formation of intermediate species of carboxylase which cannot form polymeric enzyme (45 S) in the presence of high concentrations of citrate.

The cytochromes c are a family of hemoproteins that share a number of structural features: a thioether linkage between the protein and the heme, histidine and methionine as the fifth and sixth iron ligands, and a tertiary structure known as the "cytochrome fold." These proteins follow a common mechanism of equilibrium unfolding in methanol and acid, differing only in their reactivity to the denaturing conditions. The reduced cytochromes c exhibit an increased conformational stability which is consistent with the presence of a strengthened iron-methionine linkage in the reduced state.

Purification of soluble guanylate cyclase activity from rat liver resulted in loss of enzyme responsiveness to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), nitroprusside, nitrite, and NO. Responses were restored by addition of heat-treated hepatic supernatant fraction, implying a requirement for heat-stable soluble factor(s) in the optimal expression of the actions of the activators. Addition of free hematin, hemoglobin, methemoglobin, active or heat-inactivated catalase partially restores responsiveness of purified guanylate cyclase to MNNG, NO, nitrite, and nitroprusside. These responses were markedly potentiated by the presence of an appropriate concentration of reducing agent (dithiothreitol, ascorbate, cysteine, or glutathione), which maintains heme iron in the ferro form and favors formation of paramagnetic nitrosyl . heme complexes from the activators. High concentrations of heme or reducing agents were inhibitory, and heme was not required for the expression of the stimulatory effects of Mn2+ or Mg2+ on purified guanylate cyclase. Preformed nitrosyl hemoglobin (10 micron) increased activity of the purified enzyme 10- to 20-fold over basal with Mn2+ as the metal cofactor and 90- to 100-fold with Mg2+. Purified guanylate cyclase was more sensitive to preformed NO-hemoglobin (minimally effective concentration, 0.1 micron) than to MNNG (1 micron), nitroprusside (50 micron), or nitrite (1 mM). A reducing agent was not required for optimal stimulation of guanylate cyclase by NO-hemoglobin. Maximal NO-hemoglobin-responsive guanylate cyclase was not further increased by subsequent addition of NO, MNNG, nitrite, or nitroprusside. Activation by each agent resulted in analogous alterations in the Mn2+ and Mg2+ requirements of enzyme activity, and responses were inhibited by the thiol-blocking agents N-ethylmaleimide, arsenite, or iodoacetamide. The results suggest that NO-hemoglobin, MNNG, NO, nitrite, and nitroprusside activate guanylate cyclase through similar mechanisms. The stimulatory effects of preformed NO-hemoglobin combined with the clear requirements for heme plus a reducing agent in the optimal expression of the actions of MNNG, NO, and related agents are consistent with a role for the paramagnetic nitrosyl . heme complex in the activation of guanylate cyclase.

The sensitivity of the oxygen affinity of a hemoglobin to 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid concentration has been defined as the change in log1/2O2 (deltalogp1/2O2) which results from saturating the hemoglobin with 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid. The sensitivity varies from one hemoglobin species to another and is linearly rated to the difference in the logarithm of the binding constants of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid to deoxy- and oxyhemoglobin, the characteristic pH (pHch), and inversely proportional to the magnitude of the alkaline Bohr effect measured in a saturating amount of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid. Its magnitude is higher in large animals than in small animals and varies linearly with the charged amino acid composition of the hemoglobin. The charged amino acid residues must have been selected for in mammals with high metabolic needs and against in animals with low metabolic needs. Variability in the effect of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid on the oxygen transport in the different animal hemoglobins must therefore be the result of a positive Darwinian Selection of the charged amino acid residues in their hemoglobins. Furthermore, all the charged groups and not those at the binding site alone, affect the 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid binding constant of a hemoglobin.

Mammary tumor cell growth factor(s) has been identified in extracts of platelets from both male and female rats, as well as in extracts prepared from pooled outdated human platelets. When assayed by the growth promotion of MTW9/PL rat mammary tumor cells in culture, platelet extracts alone were able to support growth 50--75% as well as whole serum. The mitogenic activity from crude human platelet lysates was shown to be trypsin sensitive, relatively stable to extremes of pH, labile to heat treatment at 70 degrees, non-dialysable, ammonium sulfate precipitable, not removed by 56 degrees charcoal treatment, and of apparent molecular weight of 30,000 to 50,000 daltons as estimated by G-100 Sephadex chromatography. The platelet derived mammary growth factor activity was not replaced or potentiated by thrombin or known hormones and growth factors such as prolactin, insulin, 17-beta-estradiol, progesterone, hydrocortisone, L-thyroxine, and mouse epidermal growth factor. The experimental report demonstrates that platelets are a rich source growth factor activity for rat epithelial mammary tumor cells, and that the activity appears to be a polypeptide(s) different from other mitogenic activities known to influence growth of mammary tissue.

Consistent with predictions from Mosher's (1966) guilt construct, the present study found that high guilt males, compared with low guilt Ss, reported significantly less use of marijuana, depressant, stimulant and hallucinogenic drugs. Among all Ss who reported at least one use within each drug category, high guilt Ss rated their experiences as less pleasant and reported a higher frequency of "bad trips" than did low guilt individuals. Overall, these results support Mosher's contention that high vs. low guilt Ss are less likely to engage in culturally prohibited activities such as drug use and are more likely to have unpleasant experiences resulting from guilt when such activities are pursued.

We have studied the intracellular binding of radioactive cobalamin by normal cultured human fibroblasts grown in medium containing [(57)Co]-cobalamin. We have also assessed the significance of defects in this binding activity exhibited by two classes of human mutants (cbl C and cbl D) each characterized by pleiotropic deficiencies in the accumulation and retention of cobalamin, in the synthesis of cobalamin coenzymes, and accordingly, in the holoenzyme activities of both cobalamin-dependent enzymes, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocysteine methyltransferase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Based on the coincidence of [(57)Co]cobalamin binding and cobalamin-dependent enzyme activities after Sephadex G-150 chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we conclude that, as in rat liver, the intracellular binding of labeled cobalamin by normal fibroblasts reflects the attachment of the vitamin to the cobalamin-dependent methyltransferase and mutase. Whereas cbl C cells are completely deficient in the binding of [(57)Co]cobalamin to either enzyme, fibroblasts which bear the phenotypically similar but genetically distinct cbl D mutation retain some binding activity, and accordingly, have higher holomethyltransferase and holomutase activities than do cbl C cells. The defect in [(57)Co]-cobalamin binding exhibited by both cbl C and cbl D fibroblasts is almost certainly not a result of mutations which affect the methyltransferase or mutase apoenzymes, since the electrophoretic mobilities and the affinities of these enzymes for their respective cobalamin coenzymes are indistinguishable from those in control cell extracts. These results suggest that both the cbl C and cbl D mutations affect some enzymatic step(s) which converts newly taken up cobalamin to a form capable of being bound by the two cobalamin-dependent enzymes.

The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of fluoride on the formation of apatite in aqeous calcium phosphate suspensions prepared by spontaneous precipitation at pH 7.4. The most notable finding was that fluoride greatly curtailed or eliminated the appearance of octacalcium phosphate-like precursor phases in these preparations.

1. In the mitral valve replacement with Starr-Edwards prosthetic ball valve, the major thromboembolism occurred in 20% of the patients with the silastic ball valve series compared with 6% in those with a metal ball valve series. 2. The anticoagulant effect of Warfarin became stable and the occurrence of thromboembolism was reduced by the addition of Bucolome.

Hydrolsis of a-naphtyl palmitate dispersed with the detergent Triton X-100 at acid pH was studied by a histochemical diazocoupling technique in both fixed sections and cultures of primate tissues as well as by a biochemical assay employing the same chromogenic substrate. Evidence for the exclusive hydrolysis of this artificial fatty acid ester substrate by acid lipases was gathered from (1) comparison of isoelectric focusing zymograms developed with different substrates, (2) kinetic analysis of enzyme activity in the presence or absence of inhibitors, including a natural substrate of acid lipase, trioleylglycerol, (3) specific localization of marked enzyme activity in certain tissues, and (4) absence of detectable enzyme activity in a case of human acid lipase deficiency (Wolman's disease). Histochemically, acid lipase activity was most readily detected in cells active in the uptake and processing of neutral lipids, i.e., the phagocytes of the reticuloendothelial system, the adrenal cortex and the lipid-storing cells in the athero-sclerotic plaques of arteries.

A cytochemical method is presented for the demonstration of proteases in human polymorphonuclear (PMN) neutrophils on fixed blood smears. This new technique is based on solubilization of proteases from PMN neutrophils by incubation with 0.25 M NaCl in borate buffer at pH 8.5 which leads to degradation of erythrocytes and plasma in a disclike zone (halo) around centrally situated PMN neutrophils, an effect that is visualized by staining smears using a modified colloidal iron reaction. Halo formation is inhibited by trypsin inhibitors of soya-bean as well as of chicken egg white mucoid and by phenylmethyl-sulfonylfluoride.

Binding of the potent beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol ([125I]IHYP) to particulate preparations from newborn mouse skin was characterized. A number of criteria were used to establish that binding occurred to specific, high affinity beta-adrenergic receptors in the skin preparations. Thus specific binding (that displaced by 10 micrometer concentrations of the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)propranolol) reached equilibrium in 15--20 min, was saturable (ligand concentration for half-maximal saturation, 0.25 nM) and freely reversible. Stereoselectivity of binding was demonstrated by the observation that displacement of [125I]IHYP by (-)propranolol occurred at concentrations at least 100 times lower than with (+)isoproterenol. Displacement was also observed with the beta-adrenergic agonists (-)isoproterenol, (-)epinephrine and (-)norepinephrine, but not with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine.

An animal model was used to determine whether vaccination with the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae could alter the development of experimental otitis media induced by the same type of S. pneumoniae as the vaccine. Following vaccination with the capsular polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae type 7, 36(63%) of 57 chinchillas seroconverted with at least a 100% increase in concentration of antibody in serum which remained elevated for at least six weeks. The middle ears of 23 chinchillas that were vaccinated and seroconverted, 13 that were vaccinated and did not seroconvert, and 47 that were not vaccinated were inoculated with S. pneumoniae type 7. Vaccinated animals that seroconverted developed otitis media as readily as nonseroconverting and unvaccinated animals but had fewer pneumococci in their middle ears, a lower incidence of bacteremia, and lower mortality rates during the first week after inoculation of bacteria. Animals that did not seroconvert showed no evidence of modification of their middle ear infections. These results indicate that type 7 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine is antigenic for the chinchilla and modifies experimental otitis media due to type 7 S. pneumoniae.

In dogs with chronic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis associated with ECFV contraction, plasma [HCO-3] ([HCO-3]p) normalizes during expansion of ECFV with a solution containing Cl- and HCO-3 in concentrations duplicating those in the plasma before expansion (isometric expansion). The kidney selectively rejects administered HCO-3 and retains Cl-. If this preferential Cl- less than HCO-3 reabsorptive selectivity were a characteristic renal response to ECFV expansion, isometric expansion during hyperchloremic acidosis would exacerbate the acid-base disturbance rather than correct it as it does in alkalosis. We examined the effect of isometric expansion in dogs with chronic hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis induced by HCl feeding or mineralocorticoid hormone deficiency. During expansion, as the expected decrease occurred in the fractional reabsorption of Na+, a lesser decrease occurred in fractional reabsorption of HCO-3, whereas a greater decrease occurred in fractional reabsorption of Cl-. The kidney selectively retained administered HCO3 and rejected Cl-. [HCO-3]p normalized. The shift to bicarbonate-selective from chloride-selective anion reabsorption during ECFV expansion in metabolic acidosis vs. metabolic alkalosis indicates that in response to ECFV expansion- the kidney selectively alters the ratio of bicarbonate to chloride concentration in the tubular reabsorbate in the direction that tends to normalize plasma acid-base composition, irrespective of the direction of deviation of the initial plasma bicarbonate concentration. The signal that initiates the shift in anion reabsorptive selectivity remains to be identified.

1. Human transferrin was labelled with ferric nitrilotriacetate (FeNTA) at one of its two metal binding sites by variation of the pH. 2. Four transferrin forms, transferrin, transferrin(Fe) (A-site), transferrin(Fe) (B-site) and transferrin(2Fe) could be separated on flat bed gels by isoelectric focussing. 3. Incubation time, temperature and medium play an important role in the specificity of the binding of Fe. In NTA-pH-buffer, at 0.5 Fe-saturation, the A-site was preferentially labelled at pH 7--8, the B-site at a pH 8--9. 4. Under physiological conditions iron from the B-site has the tendency to move to the A-site.

In intact rats nicotinamide induces an increase of tyrosine aminotransferase depending on the dose of nicotinamide. In adrenalectomized rats an increase of tyrosine aminotransferase activity is only found up to a dose of 250 mg/kg nicotinamide. The combination of nicotinamide with L-methionine and/or cortisone acetate does not cause a significant increase of the enzyme activity, which, however, can be seen in the presence of L-tyrosine.

A study was conducted of 274 children who had recurrent acute or chronic otitis media with effusion. Forty-five percent of the ears with effusion were found to contain bacteria, and 11% contained bacteria that were "probable pathogens" (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. pyogenes). Bacteria were also found in 40% of the ears without effusions. The type of organism found did not vary with the age of the patient studied or the season of the year. The significance of these bacteria in the etiology of recurrent acute or chronic otitis media with effusion remains to be demonstrated.

Selective angiography of the testicular artery was performed in 12 boys (age 3-14 yr) with nonpalpable testis. The angiographic, operative, and microscopic findings are described. True aplasia was diagnosed in seven patients. In three patients previously operated upon, the second exploration was facilitated by angiography. This method might be a valuable diagnostic aid in selected cases previously operated for gonadal disorders or inadequately explored for cryptorchism in order to avoid more extensive surgical exploration.

Three techniques were used to compare the time-dependent deformation of microfine cellulose (Elcema G250), anhydrous lactose, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (Emcompress), modified starch (Sta-Rx 1500) and sodium chloride. (1) In stress-relaxation experiments using a reciprocating tablet machine, none of the materials behaved as a Maxwell body in contrast to recent published work (David & Augsburger, 1977). Possible reasons for this disagreement are discussed. (2) Heckel plots showed that increasing the time for which a material was under compression (contact times of 0.17 and 10 s) had no effect on dicalcium phosphate compacts but increased the consolidation of other materials in the rank order sodium chloride less than lactose less than cellulose less than starch. (3) Deformation tests on preformed compacts were carried out in diametral compression by loading compacts to 75% of their breaking force at four different strain rates between 0.05 and 6.5 mm min-1. The deformation of Sta-Rx compacts was time-dependent. Sodium chloride compacts exhibited brittle behaviour in the diametral compression test and in the 10 s contact time experiment. This was apparently due to work-hardening, following the extensive plastic deformation of crystals during compaction as indicated by the stress relaxation results.

1-Amino-4-octylpiperazine, AP 22, an antiviral agent causes lipid accumulation in nervous tissue cultures. A physicochemical membrane model was used to demonstrate the formation of a lipid-AP 22 complex hindering phospholipase A2 action. A well defined amphiphilic balance seems essential to explain the mode of action of the drug. The hydrophilic group prevents enzyme-substrate complex formation whereas the hydrophobic group allows the penetration in the lipid layer and determines the stability of the drug-lipid complex. This stability of the drug-lipid association has a direct influence on phospholipase A2 activity but does not affect phospholipase C activity. No inactivation of phospholipase A2 due to a drug-enzyme interaction could be detected.

The rat globus pallidus has been investigated as a possible model in which to study pre-synaptic GABA mechanisms in vitro. (+/-)-Baclofen (300 micrometer-1 mM) significantly enhanced the release of radioactivity from superfused slices of rat globus pallidus prelabelled with 3H-GABA in vitro. This releasing action was specific to the (+)-isomer of baclofen: neither the (-)-isomer nor another neuronal depressant dl-alpha-epsilon-diaminopimelic acid had any significant effect. The releasing effect of baclofen appeared unrelated to the phenethylamine moiety of its structure as neither beta-phenethylamine nor dopamine evoked release of 3H-GABA from pallidal slices. Baclofen increased the efflux of radioactivity from pallidal slices prelabelled with either [3H]-beta-alanine or [3H]diaminobutyric acid in vitro. The use of specific glial and neuronal GABA uptake blocking compounds (beta-alanine and (+/-)-cis-1,3-amino-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid) did not permit resolution of the elements from which baclofen was evoking [3H]GABA release. Baclofen also inhibited uptake of [3H]GABA into pallidal slices with an IC50 value of 6 x 10(-4) m. The GABA-like properties of baclofen may be related to the (+)-isomer while non-specific neuronal depressant actions are an effect of the (-)-isomer. The potential of the (+)-isomer as an antipsychotic agent while (-)-baclofen remains the effective antispastic drug free from unwanted side-effects, is discussed.

The indirect sympathomimetic activity of etilefrine has been examined using the ventral caudal artery of the rat. This vessel has a rich sympathetic innervation and lends itself to studies on [3H]noradrenaline efflux from these sites. Etilefrine possessed significant indirect activity on the artery and this action, although less than that of tyramine, was equivalent to that caused by ephedrine. Pretreatment of the vessels with a mixture of iproniazid, doca, cocaine and UO521 (3',4'-dihydroxy-2-methyl propiophenone) significantly enhanced[3H]-noradrenaline efflux from the artery.

Lipolytic activity was studied in brown and white adipose tissue of rats in vitro. 5-Hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT), phenylephrine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline were used as adipokinetic agents. All stimulated lipolysis in brown adipose tissue, but 5-HT and phenyl-ephrine did not in white adipose tissue. A beta-blocking drug, propranolol, inhibited the stimulatory effect of the agents in both adipose tissues. However, an alpha-blocking drug, phentolamine, further increased the lipolysis induced by noradrenaline or adrenaline in brown adipose tissue and inhibited the effect of isoprenaline. In white adipose tissue, its action was to marginally decrease the effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Increase in the pH of the incubation medium stimulated FFA and glycerol release in brown adipose tissue, but not in the epididymal adipose tissue. This effect of pH on lipolysis was further enhanced by phentolamine and decreased by propranolol. Increase of lipolysis with pH was not seen with brown fat tissue from the reserpine-treated rats. These results show that brown adipose tissue of the rat has an alpha-receptor with inhibitory effects on lipolysis that is affected by alpha- or mixed-type adrenergic agonists, noradrenaline and adrenaline.

The colonic absorptio n of a series of aliphatic carbamates has been studied using an in situ preparation in the rat. The absorption process appeared to be passive and no metabolism by the colon membrane was detected. A linear correlation between the logarithms of the absorption rate constants and apparent partition coefficients was found. The absorption rates were not affected by concurrent water flux.

Tetracycline complexation with calcium and organic ligands was studied using fluorescence, circular dichroism, and solvent extraction methods. The results were used to interpret the mechanism of the commonly used fluorometric methods for the analysis of tetracycline in biological fluids. Tetracycline formed ternary calcium complexes with barbital sodium and L-tryptophan in alkaline solutions. The circular dichroism studies indicate that the calcium ion in these complexes is bound to the C-4 dimethylamino and the C-12a hydroxyl groups of tetracycline. These ternary complexes are strongly fluorescent and can be extracted easily into 1-butanol or ethyl acetate. Based on the characteristics of the ternary complexes and of the tetracycline degradation products, it is concluded that only the active form of tetracycline can be complexed and extracted for fluorescence analysis.

The degradation kinetics of carbuterol in aqueous solution were investigated at 85 degrees and constant ionic strength over the pH 0.25--13.3 range under anaerobic conditions. The results demonstrated a complex kinetic pattern involving specific acid and specific base catalyses at the pH extremes. Degradation resulted primarily from intramolecular catalysis and indicated that both the protonated and unprotonated phenolic groups participated in the reaction. High-pressure liquid chromatography was used to isolate carbuterol and its degradation product. Mass spectrometric examination showed that the degradation product was a cyclized derivative formed by intramolecular attack of the phenoxy group on the ureido carbonyl with ammonia expulsion. The apparent activation energy for carbuterol at pH 4.0 and 10.0 was 22.3 and 11.7 kcal/mole, respectively. The agreement between the calculated theoretical pH--rate profile and the experimental points supports the hypothesis presented concerning the reactions involved in carbuterol degradation.

The hydrolysis kinetics of halogenated nitrosoureas were investigated using chlorozotocin as a model. Evidence is presented to show that the hydrolytic reaction of halogenated nitrosoureas between pH 3 and 8 is a summation of spontaneous water and hydroxide-ion-catalyzed reactions; the later reaction is the sum of two parallel reactions. The relative contribuiton of each reaction changes with pH and results in different product distributions. Dianionic phosphate (HPO42-) increased the amount of free chloride-ion production without significantly altering the hydrolysis rate. A mechanism is proposed to explain this behavior. The role of hydrolytic decomposition products produced at physiological pH on the biological activity of nitrosoureas is discussed.

A series of 4-(substituted aminosulfonyl)- and 4-(substituted hydrazinosulfonyl)-2-aminobutanoic acids, compounds structurally related to glutamine, was synthesized as potential inhibitors of L-asparagine synthetase and subjected to screening as antitumor agents. Target amino acids were obtained by condensation of a blocked reactive sulfonyl chloride with the appropriate amine or hydrazide, followed by deblocking with hydrogen--palladium or liquid hydrogen fluoride--anisole. Neither the target compounds nor their protected precursors inhibited the enzyme from L5178Y/AR or prolonged the life of mice with P-388 lymphocytic leukemia. However, DL-4,4'-dithiobis[2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)butanoic acid], an intermediate in the synthesis of the target amino acids, exhibited 90% inhibition of L-asparagine synthetase at 10 mM.

Cholesteryl alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside, tigogenyl alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside, tigogenyl beta-D-fucopyranoside, smilagenyl beta-D-fucopyranoside, cholesteryl beta-maltoside, tigogenyl beta-maltoside, and smilagenyl beta-maltoside were synthesized and characterized. The rhamnosides and fucosides, as well as some other steroid monoglycosides, proved to be extremely insoluble in water. The concentration giving 50% hemolysis, H50, was of the same order of magnitude for all synthetic glycosides. Ghost cells collected from blood hemolyzed by smilagenyl maltoside and tigogenyl maltoside had appreciable amounts of absorbed aglycones. All results are in accordance with previous investigations on the mechanism of saponin and sapogenin hemolysis.

The intrinsic factor-mediated binding of cyanocobalamin to cholestyramine was studied in vitro under varying conditions of pH, added electrolyte, and bile salt. The intrinsic factor-cyanocobalamin complex was adsorbed strongly by the resin at pH 3 in the presence of neutral salt and low concentrations of glycocholic acid. An increase in glycocholic acid concentration as well as neutral pH decreased the observed binding, although significant amounts of cyanocobalamin-intrinsic factor complex remained bound after incubation at pH 6.8. Cyanocobalamin alone was not adsorbed by the resin.

Receptor mechanisms for narcotic-induced respiratory depression and analgesia were compared by apparent pA2 values of morphine-naloxone, levorphanol-naloxone and pentazocine-naloxone. The similarity of apparent pA2 values of the three compunds for respiratory depression suggests that morphine, levorphanol and pentazocine may interact with similar receptors to produce this effect. Significant differences between apparent pA2 values of pentazocine-naloxone and morphine-naloxone or levor-phanol-naloxone for analgesia suggest, as previously shown, that narcotic and narcotic-antagonist analgesics appear to interact with receptors in different manners. Significant differences between apparent pA2 values for respiratory depression and analgesia suggest that these two effects of the narcotic drugs are mediated by different receptor interactions.

The effect of beta adrenergic blockade on the increase in plasma renin activity produced by acute respiratory acidosis was studied in chloralose anesthetized dogs. Sixteen mongrel dogs were given 4%, 8% and 12% CO2 in room air, successively. Propranolol (2 mg/Kg) was given to 8 dogs prior to CO2 inhalation. The other 8 dogs served as the control group. The response of elevated plasma renin activity during 4% and 8% CO2 inhalation was not different between the control and propranolol groups. However, the increase of plasma renin activity in the control group was greater than that of the propranolol treated group during 12% CO2 inhalation. It is suggested that activation of beta adrenergic receptors is not the sole factor in renin control during acute respiratory acidosis, although these receptors do mediate a significant fraction of the renin response to CO2 inhalation.

Comparative clinical and experimental study of the efficacy of the currently used anti-arrhythmic agents was conducted on 610 patients (828 cases) with various disorders of the cardiac rhythm. The modern classification of these agents is given. The indications and contra-indications for the prescription of the drugs, the optimum doses, and the routes of administration are discussed. Differentiated therapy in various disorders of the cardiac rhythm is recommended.

Every stress reaction leads to an increased, hormonelly induced mobilisation of fatty acids, the extent of which may be considered as a parameter of the aggression mechanism. In 15 patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, who were operated under neurolepthypalgesia, the problem of quantitative alterations of the concentration pattern of fatty acids was investigated during the operation. In contrast to some reports of the literature, the increase of the concentration of total fatty acids was due to corresponding increases of all individual fatty acids. By preoperative administration of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent Pindolol the increase of fatty acids was reduced without a qualitative shifting of individual fatty acids.

The properties of six adsorbents for Haemoperfusion were investigated in vitro: Amberlite XAD-2; Amberlite XAD-4; Haemocol; collodion coated charcoal; albumine-collodion encapsulated charcoal and activated carbon fibers. Carbromal and diazepam are most quickly removed from aqueous solutions by Amberlite XAD-2 and XAD-4. Of the charcoal containing materials, Haemocol eliminates most rapidly carbromal and diazepam; while activated carbon fibers remove phenobarbital faster. When heparinized blood is perfused, a remarkable reduction in platelet count is observed. The drop is most pronounced with Amberlite XAD-2 and XAD-4, but even when using charcoal preparations the platelet depletion can reach 10% of the original number over 5 hours. Haemolysis is most pronounced with Amberlite XAD-2, XAD-4 and Haemocol. As the efficiency of the adsorbents towards the various drugs differ and as their adverse effects also vary, the decision for a particular material will have to be made according to the individual case.

In 22 patients with essential hypertension plasma levels and urine excretions of sodium and noradrenaline were studied before, during and after long-term beta-blockade with pindolol. The relation between mean blood pressure and the quotient of sodium-/noradrenaline-excretion changed during treatment (placebo r=-0.34; pindolol r=+0.31). During placebo there existed a significant (p is less than 0.03) correlation between blood pressure and sodium-excretion which disappeared during beta-blockade. No correlation between blood pressure and noradrenaline was seen during placebo, whereas during beta-blockade a significant (p is less than 0.003) correlation was observed. In contrast to the placebo period there was a significant positive correlation between sodium- and noradrenaline-excretion during long-term treatment with pindolol. It is concluded that whole-body balance of sodium and noradrenaline is an important factor in essential hypertension.

The Soyuz-22 space cabin atmosphere was studied for volatile organic trace contaminants. By gas chromatography the following constituents were identified: methane, ethane, heptane, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, ethyl benzene. Except for acetone, concentrations of the above compounds were close to the values determined in the mock-up experiments.

During the past decade, a new health professional has evolved--the pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP). Responding to warnings of a shortage of primary care physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics helped encourage programs to train PNPs who would provide well-child care, working under a physician's supervision. Simultaneously, in response to changing attitudes by and toward nurses, the American Nurses' Association expressed support for the expanded role of nurses in direct patient care functions--an expansion that would supplement other new academic programs in advancing the status of nursing as an interdependent, rather than subsidiary, health profession. Although mutually aiming at improvements in health care, both professions thus acted with different motivations and goals that have produced ongoing conflicts. These conflicts have been intensified by the absence of long-range planning in federal programs that have supported training for nurse practitioners. This paper summarizes the history of the PNP movement and the unresolved problems created by this new health professional.

Studies on the comparative transport capacity of various cell forms of Escherichia coli suggest that glutaraldehyde acts only in the outer regions of the cell envelope and to such an extent that transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid is reduced by 50%. Alkaline phosphatase activity in whole cells was severely impaired in the presence of alkaline glutaraldehyde and in NaCl-washed cells both acid and alkaline glutaraldehyde (0.01%) caused approximately 80-90% reduction in enzyme activity in 10 min. Protein content was reduced by only 10-15% with this concentration of glutaraldehyde, and cell volume decreased by the same extent. These results are discussed in terms of the mode of action of the disinfectant.

Some properties of a strain of mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-2, grown on DBT cells were determined using a plaque assay on the cells. Viral growth was not inhibited by the presence of actinomycin D or 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine. MHV-2 was completely inactivated by ether, chloroform, sodium deoxycholate or beta-propiolactone, but showed a moderate resistance to trypsin. Heating at 56 C for 30 min did not completely abolish the virus infectivity. The virus was stable after heating at 50 C for 15 min in 1M-MgCl2 or 1M-MgSO4 as well as at 37 C for 60 min at pH 3.0 to 9.0. Infectivity was decreased to 1/100 and 1/400 after storing at 4 C for 30 days and 37 C for 24 hr, respectively. The virus passed through a 200-nm but not a 50-nm Sartorius membrane filter. The buoyant density of MHV-2 was 1.183 g/cm3 in sucrose gradient, and the fraction contained coronavirus-like particles measuring 70 to 130 nm in diameter. Survival rate was 10% after exposure to ultraviolet at 150 ergs/mm2. Freezing and thawing or sonication at 20 kc for 3 min did not affect the virus titer. No hemagglutinin was demonstrable with red blood cells of the chicken, Japanese quail, mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig, sheep, bovine or human.

The sole of the foot in a wood merchant was lost when he trod on a circular saw which had been placed on the ground. The foot was resurfaced by immediate split skin grafts, and the result proved very satisfactory. The immediate grafting procedure took on the cancellous bone, and as an emergency procedure it is recommended while thought is being given to more elaborate procedures such as cross leg flap grafts or even amputation.

ATP-dependent and ATP-independent synthesis of DNA was studied on nucleotide-permeable cells of Bacillus stearothermophilus. The effect of temperature, pH, ionic strength, and bivalent metal ions on both types of DNA synthesis was investigated as well as their susceptibility to an SH-blocking agent. The level of ATP-independent synthesis of DNA in the cells of Bac. stearothermophilus was found to be ten times higher than that in E. coli. In the semipermeable cells of Bac. stearothermophilus, 90% of DNA of the chromosome was accessible to their nucleases. The temperature optimum of the activity of DNA polymerases and nucleases in the cells treated with toluene coincided with the optimum of the bacterial growth.

For the legal-toxicological identification on the Grandaxin--a new minor tranquillant of benzodiazepine type--a new method have been worked out. Identification by layer-chromatography and determination by UV-spectrophotometry appeared to be suitable for the study of 5 postmortal cases.

Obligate thermophilic acidophilic cultures of Bacillus acidocaldarius were isolated from hot springs and soil of the Kunashir Island (the Kuril Islands) and Southern Sakhalin; their optimum temperature of growth is 65 degrees C and pH is 3.3--4.0. It has been shown for the first time that these organisms can be isolated from springs with either acidic or neutral and weakly alkaline pH values.

The isoenzyme spectrum of dehydrogenases of alanine, aspartic and glutamic acids requiring NAD and NADP  as cofactors was studied in Candida albicans. The spectrum of aspartate dehydrogenase was found to depend on a cofactor being used. The isoenzyme systems are related to proteins which posess various physico-chemical and antigenic properties.

The rate of biological nitrogen fixation was determined by the acetylene technique in soils and on the roots of orange, mandarin and lemon trees growing in red, yellow, podzolic, alluvial brown forest, and humus-calcareous soils. The minimum nitrogen fixation in podzolic soils was 3--8 kg of nitrogen per hectare per vegetative period. The maximum nitrogen fixation (48--51 kg N per hectare) was found in red and humus-calcareous soils of orange plantations. One dose of nitrogen fertilizers with liming increased the nitrogen fixing activity of subtropic podzolic soils of mandarin plantations whereas a triple dose inhibited the activity. The rate of nitrogen fixation by the root microflora was 3--4 times higher than that by the soil microflora.

The properties of the homogeneous exoprotease preparation from Bacillus subtilis varamyloliquefaciens 759 possessing the coagulase activity were studied. The enzyme is an alkaline protease, has the isopoint at pH 7.8, and not only clots blood plasmo but also hydrolyses such protein substrates as casein, hemoglobin, fibrinogen and fibrin. The enzyme is relatively stable at pH 6.0--9.0. Bivalent metal ions have virtually no effect on the enzyme activity though some of them stabilize it. The inhibitors PCMB and EDTA do not affect the activity of the enzyme whereas diisopropylfluorophosphate completely inactivates it. Fibrinogen is clotted by the enzyme only in the presence of blood plasma factors.

Two aspects of the complexities of the mode of action of drugs are described. One is the criteria and pitfalls of defining the interaction with specific receptors. The other is the need to consider each of the pharmacological effects of a drug as a  concatenation of receptor events, because it has become clear that each drug may have substantial affinity for many specific receptors. Illustrating these ideas is a characterization of the histamine receptor linked to adenylate cyclase in brain. The activities of a series of H2-antagonists and H2-agaonists were shown to be the same on the histamine receptor linked to adenylate cyclase as on known H2-receptors. The KB values of antagonists and ED50 values of agonists were not distinguishable among these receptors. Notably, at high concentrations, the H1-antagonists are also competitive antagonists of the H2-receptor. Cyproheptadine has especially high affinity for the H2-receptor. It is the most potent H2-antagonist yet reported. Other published results are reviewed to show the variety of receptors that cyproheptadine has affinity for. Its affinity for serotonin receptors led us to examine other serotonin antagonists. On this H2-receptor linked to adenylate cyclase in homogenates of guinea pig hippocampus and cortex, D-LSD and D-2-bromo-LSD (BrLSD) were shown to be competitive antagonists of histamine. L-LSD, mescaline and psilocin were inactive. Noting congurency in the molecular structyre of D-LSD and known H2-antagonists, we predicted a new H2-antagonist. This prediction is shown to be correct: the compound has similar affinity to the H2-receptor as has LSD. The affinities of D-LSD and BrLSD for the H2-receptor are compared with their affinities for other receptors. The pharmacology of D-LSD and BrLSD is reviewed. Evidence is assembled that BrLSD has considerable central effects.

Measurement on 3,4-benzopyrene- and methylcholanthrene-induced tumours of the rat (and mouse) showed that the multiple established manipulated hyperacidification of transplantation tumours to values about pH 6 is possible also on autochthonous tumours.

A review of literature on phylogenesis of acquired immunity shows an increasing activity and potential of this complex apparatus. This system is responsible for the immunosurveillance, i.e. the control and recognition of transformed cells. Obviously the functions and morphology of the immune competent apparatus become more active and specific with growing complexity of living conditions. Since organisms become the more vulnerable the higher stages of development are reached, the sense of this evolution lies in protecting these organisms against environmental influences and in allowing survival. Recognition and elimination of malignant cells is part of this capacity acquired by evolution.

The time lapse of the effect of ifosfamid on the solid DS carcinosarcoma has been studied using 204 Wistar rats. The main results and the conclusions are as follows: 1. The transplantability of the tumor is abolished two hours after the i.v. application of 180 mg/kg isofamid (cessation of tumor cell proliferation). 2. Yet, the tumor tissue to be grafted is not damaged thoroughly by this treatment. It is possible that the still viable tumor cells were killed by the non-suppressed immune system of the recipients. 3. As determined by trypan blue dye exclusion and registration of glycolytic activity, the main part of tumor cells remains viable. As lately as 4 days after the therapy 80% of the cells incorporate trypan blue and the glycolytic activity is inhibited in the order of 80%. 4. It is to be expected that within two hours, a period sufficient for proliferation inhibition of tumor cells, only 30% of the active form of the drug administered can be found in the tumor. In this context the toxification (activation) kinetics of ifosfamid is discussed and an optimized, programmed infusion is considered. 5. The treatment with ifosfamid does not affect at least up to the third day the tumor hyperacidification attainable by a long-lasting glucose infusion.

In the system of non-syngeneic transfer of stem hemopoietic cells, the preliminary incubation of the cells of bone marrow or embryonic liver of the C57BL mice with different temperature RNA fractions isolated from the spleen of (CBAXC57BL) F1 was shown to lead to the complete or partial restoration of the colony forming ability of the donor cells. The 63 degrees RNA fraction was shown to have the greatest restorative effect.

The cardiovascular and respiratory responses to scolex-free ovine hydatid cyst fluid were studied in 65 sodium pentobarbital-anesthetized sheep. The arterial blood pressure (ABP), central venous pressure (CVP), stethogram and electrocardiogram were recorded. Intra-venous administration of 10 ml or less hydatid fluid brought about moderate to severe fall in ABP and rapid respiration or permanent respiratory cessation in majority of the animals. Forty six percent of the sheep died of circulatory and respiratory failure after the first injection or the hydatid fluid. Boiled hydatid fluid did not lose its potency to evoke the above responses. Hydrocortisone, given 200 mg daily for seven days, failed to prevent the reactions to hydatid fluid. Intravenous administration of the antihistamines chlorpheniramine, 4 mg/kg, and antazoline, 5 mg/kg, caused only partial prevention of the responses in 8 out of 15 responsive sheep. Pretreatment of the animals with atropine, 0.5--1 mg/kg subcutaneously, did not block the reactions. The cardiovascular and respiratory responses to ovine hydatid fluid may be due to antigen-antibody reactions or some toxic component of the fluid.

To test the hypothesis that birth asphyxia has a role in the etiology of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), blood was collected from the umbilical artery (UA) at birth in 28 premature infants of 26 to 29 weeks gestation and analyzed for hydrogen ion concentration [H+], PCO2, standard bicarbonate level, and lactic acid level. The infants were followed up throughout their nursery stay until a diagnosis of IVH could be made or excluded, either by autopsy or clinical findings. Infants with IVH had lower Apgar scores. There were no differences in UA [H+] or bicarbonate or lactic acid levels. However, infants with IVH had a significantly higher UA PCO2. Although the difference appeared relatively small, the increase in PCO2 during labor may have been relatively large. It is concluded that hypercarbia, possibly by increasing cerebral blood flow, may be one important factor in the genesis of IVH.

The drinking habits of 55 adolescents, aged 12 to 22 years, were evaluated in light of the current presumed upsurge in adolescent alcohol use. SGPT, SGOT, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations were essentially normal in all subjects. Serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) concentrations were elevated in 12 of 15 adolescents who consumed six or more drinks per day. It is suggested that this test may warrant inclusion among other targeted screening procedures performed in teenage patients suspected of heavy alcohol consumption.

pH, the symbol for "hydrogen-ion concentration", is a series of dimensionless "units" that have only general significance. The author shows that, when considered on the basis of the relationship to oxidation-reduction, the relative significance of any pair of coordinates becomes more significant. However, the theoretical relationship as currently accepted by the Nernst equation, i.e. a shift of 59.1 milivolts for each shift of 1.0 pH, does not apply to macromolecular systems, such as in vivo. The author solved this difficulty by plotting the corrdinates graphically by bisecting pH relationships at 7.0 and oxidation-reduction relationships at Eh 0.0 milivolts, forming four quadrants. With this scheme the significance of any pair of coordinates can be readily recognized. The application of this method to biology and medicine is shown in the companion paper "pH and Eh relationships in the body".

1. Action potentials and their maximum rates of rise, VA, were measured in single myelinated nerve fibres of the frog, Rana esculenta at room temperature. 2. On applying 1 mM procaine (pH 7.2) at 20 Hz stimulus frequency, half of the final VA reduction was reached at ton = 0.27 s; on applying 0.5 mM benzocaine (pH 7,2) at 50 HZ, ton was 0.12 s. Increasing the stimulus frequency between 2 and 50 HZ increased the rate of block by procaine but not by benzocaine. 3. Recovery in Ringer solution (pH 7.2) from 30-s treatment with 1 mM procaine (pH 7.2), the equieffective 0.15 mM procaine (pH 8.9) and from 0.5 mM benzocaine (pH 7.2) was 54%, 31% and 70%, respectively, within 1 s. 4. Changing between alkaline Ringer solution (pH 8.9) and 1 mM procaine (pH 7.2) led to transitory excessive block. Changing between 1 mM procaine (pH 7.2) and acid Ringer solution (pH 6.0) and washing out 10 mM procaine (pH 5.5) with neutral Ringer solution also led to a non-monotonic change in VA. 5. If hyperpolarizing pulses (30 ms, 20 mV) preceded the stimuli, changing the frequency of the pulse pairs led to a gradual moderate relief of block in procaine, turning off prepulses (at 10 HZ) to a gradual increase of block. In benzocaine changing from 1 to 10 HZ had no effect but turning off prepulses led to a prompt large increase of block. In procaine + benzocaine the membrane responded much as in benzocaine alone. At 1 HZ (prepulses) VA in 0.4 mM procaine was smaller than in 0.4 mM procaine + 0.3 mM benzocaine. 6. These phenomena can be explained on the assumption of voltage-dependent binding of benzocaine and procaine to a common receptor. The rate of block appears to be limited by access to the receptor, more in the case of benzocaine than of procaine.

1. We have observed that the alkaline Bohr effect of washed human fetal erythrocytes was larger than in human adult intact red cells, in physiological conditions of pH, PCO2 and temperature. This was also observed independently of the presence of CO2 and of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (fresh or stored erythrocytes). 2. Experiments performed in purified HbFII and HbA1 solutions and direct titration of protons released upon oxygenation confirmed the larger alkaline Bohr effect of fetal hemoglobin, at physiological ionic strength. 3. At low chloride concentration HbFII solutions had an alkaline Bohr effect identical to that measured in HbA1 solutions. 4. Titration of purified Hb solutions with increasing concentrations of NaCl evidenced a lower O2 linked chloride binding by HbFII and predominantly at acid pH. 5. It is concluded that the larger alkaline Bohr effect of fetal erythrocytes of HbFII solutions is related to a diminished acid Bohr effect, due to the lower affinity of HbFII for chloride anions. 6. The physiological interest of these results for placental O2 transfer (double Bohr effect) and O2 delivery to the foetus is discussed.

This report concerns application of the graphical method for representing pH and Eh relationships in macromolecular systems (see previous paper) to in vivo studies. The author presents reasons for concluding that controlled measurements of urine are satisfactory indicators of changes in pH and Eh in the body whereas blood studies remain relatively constant. The original concept had to be modified because of two little known "reversing phenomena". One is well known to physicians as the "acid rebound" because of the acid reaction of urine when an excess of a base is administered. This is a paradox because it would be expected to be more alkaline. The second phenomenon occurs following hyperoxidation, such as in narcotic addiction, and results in reduction. Both hyperalkalinity and hyperoxidation result in an acid reaction. The author concludes that they are phases of a single phenomenon. It is the basis for "Chapman's law": Unfavorable effects on the body cause the urine pH and Eh to shift away from normal whereas favorable effects cause them to shift toward normal.
